We describe a modification of the existing technique where placement is assisted by guidance to the ischial spine by a finger introduced per anum.\n\n\nMETHOD\nCadaveric dissection was carried out to confirm the accuracy of this new approach. The surface marking of the ischial spine is marked. A stimulating needle electrode inserted through a skin incision at this point, is advanced towards the ischial spine using a finger introduced per anum as a guide. Once effective stimulation of the pudendal nerve is confirmed by observed and palpated contraction of the anal musculature, a permanent stimulating electrode is inserted and the position confirmed by radiological screening.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUsing cadaveric studies, the correct surface markings for needle placement were confirmed. This technique was then applied successfully for in vivo insertion of the needle electrode in 20 patients with bowel dysfunction, with only one lead displacement occurring over a mean follow-up period of 12 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFinger-guided assistance of PNS electrode insertion is simple and reproducible without requiring neurophysiological confirmation of nerve stimulation to ensure correct lead location.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0000c8f31b6058b1b42d9580c7afaa2e673a98c2","title":"A new minimally invasive technique for pudendal nerve stimulation.","venue":"Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland","year":2012}

The long terminal repeats (LTR) control HIV transcription and reflect the major differences of distinct viral subtypes. Three regions in the HIV-1 subtype B LTR are close matches to the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) consensus sequence. Here, we show heterogeneity in these putative STAT binding sites among HIV-1 LTR subtypes A through G. Transfection of constitutively activated STAT5 lead to transcriptional activation of HIV-1 expression in 293T cells transfected with a reporter assay driven by HIV-1 LTR subtype B. Constitutively activated STAT5 transactivated the LTR of various subtypes in U937 cells with different potency. These findings support and expand the potential relevance of STAT5 activation in HIV infection and may bear relevance for a differential regulation of latency and expression of different subtypes of HIV-1.","pdfUrls":["http://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOVJ/TOVJ-1-26.pdf","https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOVJ/TOVJ-1-26.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0004750d9cfbedadef463fdd1071be1000ff21d3","title":"Heterogeneity of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription Binding Sites in the Long-Terminal Repeats of Distinct HIV-1 Subtypes","venue":"The open virology journal","year":2007}

The loudness dependence of the N1/P2 component of auditory evoked potentials (LD) has been shown to indirectly reflect central serotonergic activity. The aim of this study was to investigate LD in patients with BPD compared to healthy controls, and to evaluate the association between LD and psychopathology such as anxiety, anger or impulsiveness. Female patients with BPD were included and compared to age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Self-rating instruments, such as the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) were used to assess clinical scores of anxiety, anger, and impulsiveness. Evoked potentials were recorded following the application of acoustic stimuli with increasing intensities; the LD was analysed using dipole source analysis. The mean LD was significantly higher in patients with BPD compared to controls. In the entire sample there were significant positive correlations of LD with state anxiety scores and STAXI subscores. The data contribute to the knowledge of neurophysiological alterations in patients with BPD, supporting the hypothesis of serotonergic dysregulation in the pathophysiology of the disorder. The significant clinical correlations suggest monoaminergic modulations of psychopathology on the symptom level.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00062e38e27172c7b5bced48478779fb30c1088e","title":"Loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials in patients with borderline personality disorder--impact of psychopathology.","venue":"Psychiatry research","year":2012}

We show that an optimal policy exists and suggest a value iteration algorithm to compute it. Since in general this algorithm is computationally very intensive , we also consider a \" greedy \" solution that scales well with the dimension of the problem. Under this policy, at each time step the pursuers move towards the locations that maximize the probability of finding an evader at the next time.

In striking contrast, the mutants did not affect virion infectivity, during which time the gp41 protein is embedded in the HIV envelope membrane. To examine the role of LLP2/membrane interactions, we applied synchrotron x-radiation to determine structure of hydrated membranes. We focused on WT LLP2 peptide (+3 charge) and MX2 mutant (-1 charge) with membrane mimics for the T-cell and the HIV-1 membranes. To investigate the influence of electrostatics, cholesterol content, and peptide palmitoylation, we also studied three other LLP2 variants and HIV-1 mimics without negatively charged lipids or cholesterol as well as extracted HIV-1 lipids. All LLP2 peptides bound strongly to T-cell membrane mimics, as indicated by changes in membrane structure and bending. In contrast, none of the weakly bound LLP2 variants changed the HIV-1 membrane mimic structure or properties. This correlates well with, and provides a biophysical basis for, previously published results that reported lack of a mutant effect in HIV virion infectivity in contrast to an inhibitory effect in T-cell syncytium formation. It shows that interaction of LLP2 with the T-cell membrane modulates biological function.","pdfUrls":["http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1221&context=physics","http://lipid.phys.cmu.edu/papers13/BosciaSI.pdf","http://lipid.phys.cmu.edu/papers13/BosciaBJ.pdf","http://lipid.phys.cmu.edu/papers13/2013LLP2-Both.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/000c960ae003efb2d3ee99400ad931a808b89046","title":"Membrane structure correlates to function of LLP2 on the cytoplasmic tail of HIV-1 gp41 protein.","venue":"Biophysical journal","year":2013}

A testable prediction of the hypothesis that extra-pair reproduction partly reflects indirect selection on females is that extra-pair young (EPY) will be fitter than their within-pair young (WPY) maternal half-siblings. This prediction has not been comprehensively tested in a wild population, requiring data on the lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of maternal half-sib EPY and WPY. We used 17 years of genetic parentage data from song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, to compare the LRS of hatched EPY and WPY maternal half-siblings measured as their lifetime number of hatched offspring, recruited offspring, and hatched grandoffspring. EPY hatchlings were not significantly fitter than WPY hatchlings for any of three measures of LRS. Furthermore, opposite to prediction, EPY hatchlings tended to have lower LRS than their maternal half-sibling WPY hatchlings on average. EPY also tended to be less likely to survive to hatch than their maternal half-sibling WPY. Taken together, these results fail to support one key hypothesis explaining the evolution of genetic polyandry by socially monogamous females and suggest there may be weak indirect selection against female extra-pair reproduction in song sparrows.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/000e0bb3407500709200e2943827cedf69ea9a6d","title":"Are there indirect fitness benefits of female extra-pair reproduction?

In order to understand how these pathways interact, this thesis applies a systems biology approach through a two-step process. First, we constructed an integrated mathematical model for shear-stress-induced nitric oxide (NO) production to assemble the current understanding of this signaling system. Second, we conducted experiments to define how shear stress dynamically modulates the expression of components of the endothelial glycocalyx, a mechanosensor that regulates shear-stress-dependent NO production. Nitric oxide produced by vascular endothelial cells is an anti-inflammatory mediator and a potent vasodilator. In order to understand the rich diversity of responses observed experimentally in endothelial cells exposed to shear stress, we assembled four quantitative molecular pathways previously defined for shear-stress-induced NO production. In these pathways, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is activated (a) via calcium release, (b) via phosphorylation reactions, and (c) via enhanced protein expression. To these pathways we added (d) an additional pathway describing the actual NO production from the interactions of eNOS with its various protein partners. These pathways were then combined and simulated. The integrated model is able to describe the experimentally observed change in NO production with time following the application of fluid shear stress, and to predict the specific effects to the system following interventional pharmacological or genetic changes. Importantly, this model reflects the up-to-date understanding of the NO system and provides a platform to aggregate information in an additive way. The endothelial glycocalyx is a glycosaminoglycan layer located on the apical surface of vascular endothelial cells. Previous studies have documented a strong correlation between the glycocalyx expression, local hemodynamic environment, and atheroprotection. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the expression of components of the endothelial glycocalyx is differentially regulated by distinct hemodynamic environments. In order to test this hypothesis, human endothelial cells were exposed to shear stress waveforms characteristic of atherosclerosis-resistant or atherosclerosis-susceptible regions of the human carotid, and the expression of several components of the glycocalyx was then assessed. Interestingly, we found that heparan sulfate expression is higher and evenly distributed on the apical surface of endothelial cells exposed to the atheroprotective waveform, and is irregularly present in cells exposed to the atheroprone waveform. Furthermore, the expression of a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, syndecan-1, is also differentially regulated by the two waveforms, …","pdfUrls":["http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/80253/853451854-MIT.pdf?sequence=2"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0010383450e2f9671862ade55938cc68d15536ee","title":"Systems Biology of Endothelial Mechano-activated Pathways Libraries Systems Biology of the Endothelial Mechano-activated Pathways","venue":"","year":2013}

MuseumOfMe, Facebook Lookback, and Google Awesome are some popular examples. One core challenge to the creation of such life summaries is the identification of personal events, and their time frame. Such videos can greatly benefit from automatically distinguishing between social media content that is about someone's own wedding from that week, to an old wedding, or to that of a friend. In this paper, we describe our approach for identifying a number of common personal life events from social media content (in this paper we have used Twitter for our test), using multiple feature-based classifiers. Results show that combination of linguistic and social interaction features increases overall classification accuracy of most of the events while some events are relatively more difficult than others (e.g. new born with mean precision of .6 from all three models).","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1210/SP2014_04.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0011831d6d86f54148cd0ee1d280ad7b160498ba","title":"Personal Life Event Detection from Social Media","venue":"HT","year":2014}

INTRODUCTION The tremendous demands from social markets are pushing the booming development of mobile communications faster than ever before, and therefore plenty of new advanced techniques emerge. Wider bandwidth, manifold networks, and more powerful capability, together with advances in computing technology have brought more and more miscellaneous services to be delivered with more excellent quality. Mobile service subscriber in some advanced countries has already surpassed fixed communications. Now is the time for deploying 3G mobile communications while research of 4G is just in the ascendant. The phenomenal growth in mobile and wireless communications entails the serious problem of security. The causes, mainly due to the frangibility of wireless and mobile features and the variety of applications and services, fall into the following categories. • The physical weaknesses and limitations of mobile and wireless communications, e.g. high error rate and unpredictable error behavior due to external interference and mobility, introduce influences on characteristics of not only performance but also security.","pdfUrls":["http://www.ijest.info/docs/IJEST-NCICT-018-181.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0018a629ea16042cd2007889a1a91ae693e10951","title":"Implementation of Mobile Security Using Hierarchical Framework Model","venue":"","year":2010}

The model uses pressure and flow measurements to estimate time-dependent resistance and elasticity factor. The model includes a resistance that has a function of the cross-section and urethral elasticity. Two resistivity types are compared in the constricted flow-controlling zone of the urethra: Poiseouille resistance and the Bernoulli effect. Using real pressure-flow data sets, the model was used to estimate urethral resistance and changes in urethral elasticity during voiding. Estimation of the elasticity show that in a normal patient relaxation of the urethra is a process that continues until the end of voiding. This has important implications with regard to the present methods that are used in the clinic to assess urethral obstruction or constriction. The resistance as calculated by this model, may be a useful indicator of urethral constriction and obstruction, since it is especially independent of the bladder function. Changes in the urethral elasticity during voiding which are estimated by the model add a new diagnostic parameter to pressure-flow studies.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0010-4825(00)00020-2"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/001b6877d0b436ef3669f5897d19e7a0c4879f5d","title":"Model-based estimation of male urethral resistance and elasticity using pressure-flow data","venue":"Comp. in Bio. and Med.","year":2001}

In a previous paper, we have proposed a nonlinear Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration method, which avoids computing explicit eigenvectors except at the first self-consistent-field (SCF) iteration. The method may be viewed as an approach to solve the original nonlinear Kohn-Sham equation by a nonlinear subspace iteration technique, without emphasizing the intermediate linearized Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problems. It reaches self-consistency within a similar number of SCF iterations as eigensolver-based approaches. However, replacing the standard diagonalization at each SCF iteration by a Chebyshev subspace filtering step results in a significant speedup over methods based on standard diagonalization. Here, we discuss an approach for implementing this method in multi-processor, parallel environment. Numerical results are presented to show that the method enables to perform a class of highly challenging DFT calculations that were not feasible before.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.umn.edu/~saad/PDF/umsi-2006-101.pdf","http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~saad/PDF/umsi-2006-101.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/001bb1b73afd16dcd3166cb3bf00fcbe2b92f138","title":"Parallel self-consistent-field calculations via Chebyshev-filtered subspace acceleration.","venue":"Physical review.

In addition, the cross-sectional correlation between PTSD and PTG weakened from T1 to T3. These results indicate that PTSD and PTG can coexist in individuals after a traumatic experience, and they further suggest that the reduction in PTSD does not indicate the appearance of PTG.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0020d386dee5b5cd385bce4b1ef347db1f124576","title":"Longitudinal linkages between posttraumatic stress disorder and posttraumatic growth in adolescent survivors following the Wenchuan earthquake in China: A three-wave, cross-lagged study.","venue":"Psychiatry research","year":2015}

Abstract \" Behavior-based personalization \" has gained popularity in recent years, whereby businesses offer personalized products based on consumers' purchase histories. This paper highlights two perils of behavior-based personalization in competitive markets. First, although purchase histories reveal consumer preferences, competitive exploitation of such information damages differentiation, similar to the classic finding that behavior-based price discrimination intensifies price competition. With endogenous product design, there is yet a second peril. It emerges when forward-looking firms try to avoid the first peril by suppressing the information value of purchase histories. Ideally, if a market leader serves all consumers on day one, purchase histories contain no information about consumer preferences. However, knowing that their rivals are willing to accommodate a market leader, firms are more likely to offer a mainstream design at day one, which jeopardizes differentiation. Based on this understanding, I investigate how the perils of behavior-based personalization change under alternative market conditions, such as firms' better knowledge about their own customers, consumer loyalty and inertia, consumer self-selection, and the need for classic designs.","pdfUrls":["http://dspace.mit.edu/openaccess-disseminate/1721.1/67710"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00227b167f2bd46369e50fd2e75c9a08dc82d830","title":"The Perils of Behavior-based Personalization Accessed Terms of Use Detailed Terms the Perils of Behavior-based Personalization the Perils of Behavior-based Personalization","venue":"","year":2010}

Preventive maintenance works, such as road rehabilitation will help to reduce the major road repairs and expenditure. Prior to this, a good database, gathered through GIS will be necessary in order to ensure maintenance is done effectively.

This system is capable of storing, managing, analyzing, computing and displaying all forms of geographical data for road maintenance works. In this study, the author has adopted GIS application software – ArcView, and has reviewed and analyzed its effectiveness in managing road database.

Molecular and cell biological tools that can facilitate visualization of actin organization and dynamics in a minimally invasive manner are essential for understanding this fundamental component of the living cell.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA novel, monomeric (m) Eos-fluorescent protein derived from the coral Lobophyllia hemprichii was assessed for its green to red photo-convertibility in plant cells by creating mEosFP-cytosolic. mEosFP was fused to the F-(filamentous)-Actin Binding Domain of the mammalian Talin gene to create mEosFP::FABDmTalin. Photo-conversion, visualization and colour quantification protocols were developed for EosFP targeted to the F-actin cytoskeleton. Rapid photo-conversion in the entire cell or in a region of interest was easily achieved upon illumination with an approximately 400 nm wavelength light beam using an epi-fluorescent microscope. Dual color imaging after photo-conversion was carried out using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Time-lapse imaging revealed that although photo-conversion of single mEosFP molecules can be rapid in terms of live-cell imaging it involves a progressive enrichment of red fluorescent molecules over green species. The fluorescence of photo-converted cells thus progresses through intermediate shades ranging from green to red. The time taken for complete conversion to red fluorescence depends on protein expression level within a cell and the quality of the focusing lens used to deliver the illuminating beam. Three easily applicable methods for obtaining information on fluorescent intensity and colour are provided as a means of ensuring experimental repeatability and data quantification, when using mEosFP and similar photo-convertible proteins.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe mEosFP::FABD-mTn probe retains all the imaging qualities associated with the well tested GFP::mTn probe while allowing for non-invasive, regional photo-conversion that allows colour based discrimination within a living cell. Whereas a number of precautions should be exercised in dealing with photo-convertible probes, mEosFP::FABD-mTn is a versatile live imaging tool for dissecting the organization and activity of the actin cytoskeleton in plants.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/72/c7/1746-4811-4-21.PMC2557004.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/72/c7/Plant_Methods_2008_Sep_19_4_21.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0024898efd7edbb0e4d9e357ae1b24d8c61b8bd8","title":"Visualizing the actin cytoskeleton in living plant cells using a photo-convertible mEos::FABD-mTn fluorescent fusion protein","venue":"Plant methods","year":2008}

The objective of this study was to determine the comparative effectiveness of multislice helical CT alone to diagnose acute unstable cervical spine injury following blunt trauma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors performed a meta-analysis of studies comparing modern CT with adjunctive imaging modalities and required that studies present acute traumatic findings as well as treatment for unstable injuries. Study quality, population characteristics, diagnostic protocols, and outcome data were extracted. Positive disease status included all injuries necessitating surgical or orthotic stabilization identified on imaging and/or clinical follow-up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventeen studies encompassing 14,327 patients met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity for modern CT were both > 99.9% (95% CI 0.99-1.00 and 0.99-1.00, respectively). The negative likelihood ratio of an unstable cervical injury after a CT scan negative for acute injury was < 0.001 (95% CI 0.00-0.01), while the negative predictive value of a normal CT scan was 100% (95% CI 0.96-1.00). Global severity of injury, CT slice thickness, and study quality did not significantly affect accuracy estimates.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nModern CT alone is sufficient to detect unstable cervical spine injuries in trauma patients. Adjuvant imaging is unnecessary when the CT scan is negative for acute injury. Results of this meta-analysis strongly show that the cervical collar may be removed from obtunded or intubated trauma patients if a modern CT scan is negative for acute injury.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0027e20efb268d975f391179ea341e1d3c5c8c35","title":"Comparative effectiveness of using computed tomography alone to exclude cervical spine injuries in obtunded or intubated patients: meta-analysis of 14,327 patients with blunt trauma.","venue":"Journal of neurosurgery","year":2011}

The most popular of such extensions is the notion of named graphs (NG). One prominent use of NG is related to management of datasets, integrating information from multiple sources. Technically, this requires storage, modification, and querying of modularized RDF graphs in semantic repositories. For NG to serve this purpose properly there needs to be a clear definition for the semantics of operations like addition and removal of quadruples from such datasets. While there is a consensus about the NG name, there is no single standard specification of the NG model, nor a specification of the abovementioned semantics. Here we propose semantics for the operations addition and removal of <S,P,O,G> quadruples from integrated datasets. We also motivate the need to further extend the RDF model and propose a specific mechanism called triplesets. The proposed mechanism is already supported in the OWLIM repository and it is used for large scale reasoning in LarKC and other projects. Finally, we outline the need of further standardization work related to this proposal with regard to serialization and querying. Resource Description Framework (RDF), [6], is a language for representing information about resources in the World Wide Web. Although it was designed to represent metadata about Web resources, RDF has much broader use as a generic data model for structured data management and reasoning. Named graph, [3], is an RDF graph with a URI, [1], assigned as a name. In an extended RDF model one can deal simultaneously with multiple named graphs and make statements about them, by putting their URI name in subject position. A more concrete definition is provided in the specification of SPARQL, [8], where queries are evaluated against datasets, composed from multiple RDF graphs. In SPARQL, an RDF Dataset is defined as ","pdfUrls":["http://www.w3.org/2009/12/rdf-ws/papers/ws24.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00280593cf50fb4bdd9917d795e7f104b0d356a6","title":"Triplesets: Tagging and Grouping in Rdf Datasets 1 Named Graphs – the Current State of Affairs","venue":"","year":2010}

However, DNA-based analysis of organisms lacking sequenced genomes cannot rely on RNA-seq data alone to isolate most genes of interest, as DNA codes both exons and introns. With this in mind, we designed a novel tool, LEMONS, that exploits the evolutionary conservation of both exon/intron boundary positions and splice junction recognition signals to produce high throughput splice-junction predictions in the absence of a reference genome. When tested on multiple annotated vertebrate mRNA data, LEMONS accurately identified 87% (average) of the splice-junctions. LEMONS was then applied to our updated Mediterranean chameleon transcriptome, which lacks a reference genome, and predicted a total of 90,820 exon-exon junctions. We experimentally verified these splice-junction predictions by amplifying and sequencing twenty randomly selected genes from chameleon DNA templates.

To study whether schizotypy is associated with differences in how categories activate their exemplars, we examined the N400 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) elicited during a category-verification task. ERPs were recorded in young adults from the general population while they viewed category definitions each followed by a target that was either a high-typicality exemplar, low-typicality exemplar, or non-exemplar; participants' task was to indicate whether or not the target belonged to the category. Schizotypy was assessed via the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ). Overall, N400 amplitude was largest for non-exemplars, smallest for high-typicality exemplars, and intermediate for low-typicality exemplars. SPQ score was associated with decreased N400 amplitude to non-exemplars, and increased amplitude to both types of exemplars. SPQ score was negatively correlated with the N400 amplitude difference between non-exemplars and both low- and high-typicality exemplars, but was not correlated with the amplitude difference between low- and high-typicality exemplars. N400 amplitude differences between non-exemplars and both types of exemplars were correlated with the SPQ Interpersonal factor, but not the Disorganized factor. The results are consistent with an association of schizotypy with decreased use of context to activate related items and inhibit unrelated items.","pdfUrls":["http://kutaslab.ucsd.edu/people/kutas/pdfs/2005.SR.329.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/002f949e9b07a0218b964a76cd01e5f4ae5e7ecb","title":"Association of schizotypy with semantic processing differences: an event-related brain potential study.","venue":"Schizophrenia research","year":2005}

However, subgroup analysis found that -460TT homozygote variant might confer significantly increased cancer risk for Asians (TT vs. CC: OR=1.69, 95% CI 1.08-2.63, p=0.02), but not in Caucasians. Similar results were observed in -2578C>A in Asians (AA vs. CC: OR=3.00, 95% CI 1.51-5.95, p=0.002; AA vs. AC: OR=3.15, 95% CI 1.00-9.91, p=0.05; AA vs. (AC+CC): OR=2.92, 95% CI 1.51-5.65, p=0.001). In lung cancer survival, 4 trials included had conflicting results. One found -460C>T polymorphism had no effect on survival, 1 observed risk increasing, while the remaining 2 observed risk decreasing. This inconsistency was closely related to the different therapeutic practices applied in different studies, the effects of which were significantly affected by VEGF expression.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n-460TT and -2578AA homozygote might lead to significantly increased cancer risk for Asians, but the effects on survival remain to be explored. These 2 SNPs might be potential indicators of lung cancer risk for Asians and should be considered when planning chemotherapy and radiotherapy for lung cancer patients.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/8a/7d/medscimonit-20-2520.PMC4263404.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0030c7052fdba87fa2629976aad5c7380f97c82d","title":"rs833061 and rs699947 on Promoter Gene of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Associated Lung Cancer Susceptibility and Survival: A Meta-Analysis","venue":"Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","year":2014}

Because this model is to be used for the design of such algorithms, we look for an analytical derivation instead of a simulative tool.

We examined the effects of KCl, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), veratridine, ouabain and tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) on Ca(2+)-independent (carrier-mediated) and Ca(2+)-dependent (exocytotic) release. We found that, in the absence of Ca2+, KCl at 40 mM releases 7.57 +/- 0.65%, veratridine at 50 microM releases 45.85 +/- 2.48%, ouabain at 1 mM releases 8.62 +/- 0.93% and TPP+ at 1 mM releases 4.09 +/- 0.37% of the total accumulated neurotransmitter, provided that the external medium contains Na+. These are about the maximal values of release obtained with each depolarizing agent in a Na+ medium and in the absence of Ca2+. Replacing external Na+ with choline blocks the release observed in the presence of the depolarizing agents in the absence of Ca2+, and this divalent ion can increase [3H]GABA release only for K+ or 4-AP. Synaptosomal depolarization requires Na+ except for K+ depolarization. Furthermore, although Ca2+ stimulates the release of [3H]GABA due to K+ depolarization (13.56 +/- 0.44%) or due to 4-AP (4.26 +/- 0.51%), it inhibits the release due to the other depolarizing agents. The amount of [3H]GABA released by 4-AP in Na+ medium (4.26 +/- 0.51%) is similar to that induced by KCl in the presence of Ca2+ in the absence of Na+ (3.39 +/- 0.29%) which represents only exocytotic release. This suggests that the Ca(2+)-dependent exocytotic release of [3H]GABA can be specifically induced by 4-AP in a Na+ medium, or by KCl in the absence of Na+, as reported by us earlier. The observation that Ca2+ inhibits the Ca(2+)-independent release is of interest because it suggests that Ca2+ may modulate the release of cytoplasmic GABA probably by inhibiting the carrier-mediated release of GABA. It is of interest as to whether Ca2+ regulation depends on intracellular Ca2+.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/003a2f55762ec2c91c9abc9df63b3c55d2517847","title":"Effect of depolarizing agents on the Ca(2+)-independent and Ca(2+)-dependent release of [3H]GABA from sheep brain synaptosomes.","venue":"Biochemical pharmacology","year":1992}

Date Abstract ii Abstract The 1.5-dimensional terrain guarding problem gives an x-monotone chain (the terrain) and asks for the minimum set of vertices of the terrain (guards) such that every vertex of the terrain is seen by at least one guard. This terrain guarding problem is a restriction of the Set Cover problem, which is known to be both NP-complete and inapproximable within a sub-logarithmic factor [19]. Fortunately, it is known that the 1.5-dimensional terrain guarding problem is approximable to within a constant factor [5, 11], though no attempt has been made to minimize the approximation factor. We give a 4-approximation algorithm for the general 1.5D terrain guarding problem, as well as a 2-approximation algorithm for the case with upward-looking guards, i.e. when guards cannot see vertices that are below themselves.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jking/papers/guarding_thesis.pdf","http://www.jking.ca/papers/guarding_thesis.pdf","http://www.cs.ubc.ca/grads/resources/thesis/Nov05/James_King.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/003aacc413acab2f1fe1c14ce3cf10e61b677f85","title":"Approximation Algorithms for Guarding 1.5 Dimensional Terrains","venue":"","year":2005}

Fast and reliable analysis of image data is one of the key points in soccer robot performance. In this paper we suggest a very fast method for object finding which uses the concept of perspective view. In our method, we introduce a set of jump points in perspective on which we search for objects. An object is estimated by a rectangle surrounding it. A vector based calculation is introduced to find the distance and angle of a robot from objects in the field. In addition we present a new color model which takes its components from different color models. The proposed method can detect all objects in each frame and their distance and angle in one scan on the jump points in that frame. This process takes about 1 50 of a second. Our vision system uses a commercially available frame grabber and is implemented only in software. It has shown a very good performance in RoboCup competitions.","pdfUrls":["http://msl.cs.uiuc.edu/~chitsaz/pubs/vision.pdf","http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/~hchitsaz/pubs/vision.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45603-1_8","http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~bssadjad/publications/vision9.ps"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/003cd0e57e0194f75fed8e1a6288809f7ec823b2","title":"A Fast Vision System for Middle Size Robots in RoboCup","venue":"RoboCup","year":2001}

In this paper, a theory based on multi-variable information fusion is studied to evaluate the health level of multifunctional sensors. A novel conception of health reliability degree (HRD) is defined to indicate a quantitative health level, which is different from traditional so-called qualitative fault diagnosis. To evaluate the health condition from both local and global perspectives, the HRD of a single sensitive component at multiple time points and the overall multifunctional sensor at a single time point are defined, respectively. The HRD methodology is emphasized by using multi-variable data fusion technology coupled with a grey comprehensive evaluation method. In this method, to acquire the distinct importance of each sensitive unit and the sensitivity of different time points, the information entropy and analytic hierarchy process method are used, respectively. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed strategy, a health evaluating experimental system for multifunctional self-validating sensors was designed. The five different health level situations have been discussed. Successful results show that the proposed method is feasible, the HRD could be used to quantitatively indicate the health level and it does have a fast response to the performance changes of multifunctional sensors.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s130100587","http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/13/1/587/pdf?y=1","http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/13/1/587/pdf/","http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/13/1/587/pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/003d2e721c381a450ef106cd3ecf6c63c251578e","title":"A Novel Health Evaluation Strategy for Multifunctional Self-Validating Sensors","venue":"Sensors","year":2013}

We assessed whether home-based HIV care was as effective as was facility-based care.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe undertook a cluster-randomised equivalence trial in Jinja, Uganda. 44 geographical areas in nine strata, defined according to ratio of urban and rural participants and distance from the clinic, were randomised to home-based or facility-based care by drawing sealed cards from a box. The trial was integrated into normal service delivery. All patients with WHO stage IV or late stage III disease or CD4-cell counts fewer than 200 cells per microL who started antiretroviral therapy between Feb 15, 2005, and Dec 19, 2006, were eligible, apart from those living on islands. Follow-up continued until Jan 31, 2009. The primary endpoint was virological failure, defined as RNA more than 500 copies per mL after 6 months of treatment. The margin of equivalence was 9% (equivalence limits 0.69-1.45). Analyses were by intention to treat and adjusted for baseline CD4-cell count and study stratum. This trial is registered at http://isrctn.org, number ISRCTN 17184129.\n\n\nFINDINGS\n859 patients (22 clusters) were randomly assigned to home and 594 (22 clusters) to facility care. During the first year, 93 (11%) receiving home care and 66 (11%) receiving facility care died, 29 (3%) receiving home and 36 (6%) receiving facility care withdrew, and 8 (1%) receiving home and 9 (2%) receiving facility care were lost to follow-up. 117 of 729 (16%) in home care had virological failure versus 80 of 483 (17%) in facility care: rates per 100 person-years were 8.19 (95% CI 6.84-9.82) for home and 8.67 (6.96-10.79) for facility care (rate ratio [RR] 1.04, 0.78-1.40; equivalence shown). Two patients from each group were immediately lost to follow-up. Mortality rates were similar between groups (0.95 [0.71-1.28]). 97 of 857 (11%) patients in home and 75 of 592 (13%) in facility care were admitted at least once (0.91, 0.64-1.28).\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nThis home-based HIV-care strategy is as effective as is a clinic-based strategy, and therefore could enable improved and equitable access to HIV treatment, especially in areas with poor infrastructure and access to clinic care.","pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673609616743","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673609616743"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/003e78ccd6f44bb38c5b92784d8cb8d6830b7de3","title":"Rates of virological failure in patients treated in a home-based versus a facility-based HIV-care model in Jinja, southeast Uganda: a cluster-randomised equivalence trial","venue":"The Lancet","year":2009}

This was confirmed when sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPP) and negative (NPP) predictive power of individual prodromal symptoms were examined. Although DSM-III-R schizophrenia prodromal symptoms do occur more commonly in schizophrenia, they are by no means pathognomonic of that disorder.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/003e833491b04e9a208e124aa3ea472dd075fcf8","title":"Prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia in first-episode psychosis: prevalence and specificity.","venue":"Comprehensive psychiatry","year":1995}

Only studies reporting the performance of US for diagnosis of CPPD disease were selected. A meta-analysis involved the inverse variance method to evaluate global sensitivity and specificity of US. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran Q-test and I(2) values.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe search resulted in 85 articles and 11 abstracts; 17 and 4, respectively, were selected for the systematic review. A total of 262 patients with CPPD disease and 335 controls from 4 original articles and 4 abstracts were included in the meta-analysis. The US diagnostic patterns most frequently recorded were thin hyperechoic bands in the hyaline cartilage (8 articles); hyperechoic spots in fibrous cartilage or in tendons (7 articles); and homogeneous hyperechoic nodules localised in bursa or articular recesses (4 articles). The meta-analysis revealed a heterogeneity of the data, with a sensitivity of 87.9% (95% CI 80.9% to 94.9%) and specificity of 91.5% (95% CI 85.5% to 97.5%) using a random model.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis meta-analysis confirmed that US has high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CPPD and may be a promising tool for the diagnosis and management of CPPD.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/85/a4/rmdopen-2015-000118.PMC4623362.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/003f95335b69fb8b325921205eb7185085d952bf","title":"Diagnostic value of ultrasound in calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis","venue":"RMD open","year":2015}

We then identify two kinds of integration problems. The rst one is concerned with integrating the knowledge bases of diierent knowledge-based systems employed in an organization into one physically or virtually uniied knowledge base which is to be considered as part of the organization's OM. The second problem concerns the integration of several representations of the same knowledge with diierent degrees of formalization, ranging from formally represented knowledge via semi-structured text to plain text. It is argued to solve the two integration problems by making use of a high-level language whose representation ontology is explicitly deened. Such a language is rather comprehensive, but only parts of it are used at a time and actual inferencing is done in optimized, low-level formalisms to which this language is compiled.","pdfUrls":["http://research.swisslife.ch/Papers/data/orgmem/kaw98/kaw_paper.ps.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/003fa0bb0161ddf757ec3208d540ec6bde0e3587","title":"Knowledge Integration for Building Organizational Memories","venue":"","year":1998}

Instead, many use Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) mediated mechanisms to disrupt host cell homeostasis. We identified a T3SS effector protein, VopX, which is translocated into mammalian cells during in vitro co-culture. In a S. cerevisiae model system, we found that expression of VopX resulted in a severe growth defect that was partially suppressed by a deletion of RLM1, encoding the terminal transcriptional regulator of the Cell Wall Integrity MAP kinase (CWI) regulated pathway. Growth of yeast cells in the presence of sorbitol also suppressed the defect, supporting a role for VopX in destabilizing the cell wall. Expression of VopX activated expression of β-galactosidase from an RLM1-reponsive element reporter fusion, but failed to do so in cells lacking MAP kinases upstream of Rlm1. The results suggest that VopX inhibits cell growth by stimulating the CWI pathway through Rlm1. Rlm1 is an ortholog of mammalian MEF2 transcription factors that are proposed to regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The collective findings suggest that VopX contributes to disease by activating MAP kinase cascades that elicit changes in cellular transcriptional programs.","pdfUrls":["http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/7/10/4099/pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0043b2ddfb4cafc74de7f1cc8986d9adae443011","title":"Using S. cerevisiae as a Model System to Investigate V. cholerae VopX-Host Cell Protein Interactions and Phenotypes","venue":"Toxins","year":2015}

HandelC offers constructs that allow programmers to express instruction level parallelism. Also, HandelC offers primitives that allow task level parallelism. However, HandelC does not offer any runtime support that enables programmers to express task level parallelism efficiently. This thesis discusses this issue and suggests a support library called HCthreads as a solution. HCthreads offers a subset of Pthreads functionality and interface relevant to the HandelC environment. This study offers means to identify the best configuration of HC-threads to achieve the highest speedups in real systems. This thesis investigates the issue of integrating HandelC within platforms not supported by Celoxica. A support library is implemented to solve this issue by utilizing the high level abstractions offered by Hthreads. This support library abstracts away any HWTI specific synchronization making the coding experience quite close to software. HCthreads is proven effective and generic for various algorithms with different threading behaviors. HCthreads is an adequate method to implement recursive algorithms even if no task level parallelism is warranted. Not only HCthreads offers such versatility, it achieves modest speedups over instruction level parallelism ad-hoc approaches. The Hthreads support library served its intended purpose by allowing HCthreads real system tests to proceed on a third party platform. No major issues were reported while conducting these tests, still additional investigation and verification is required.","pdfUrls":["http://ittc.ku.edu/research/thesis/documents/Thamer_Abuyasin_thesis.pdf","http://www.ittc.ku.edu/research/thesis/documents/Thamer_Abuyasin_thesis.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00446e68d60ef6515be82eb1bea45b633c738e1c","title":"Enabling Task Level Parallelism in Handelc","venue":"","year":2007}

We focused on several related computational tasks: (i) predicting druggable binding sites from a single structure; (ii) predicting protein­protein interaction patches from a single structure; (iii) predicting conformations of protein loops in models by homology with high accuracy; (iv) accurate docking of flexible ligands to flexible protein pockets and virtual screening; and (v) protein docking and refinement of flexible protein interfaces. We demonstrated that the small molecule binding pockets can be predicted with a certain transformation of the Lennard Jones potential. This prediction does not depend on the ligand and captures the majority of the actual binding sites (96% of all known pockets at the 50% overlap level) [1]. This algorithm is useful in predicting new or allosteric binding sites or the feasibility of inhibiting protein­protein interaction with a small molecule. Predicting transient protein­protein interaction interfaces without a known partner was also proposed and validated on a large benchmark [2]. Predicting conformations of potentially flexible protein loops is an important task in docking ligands and fragments. We introduced an improved conformational sampling protocol that predicted loops of up to 15 residue long with high crystallographic resolution accuracy (under 0.5 for the backbone atoms and under 1A for the side chains). The protocol was tested on a large benchmark of loops. Including the receptor pocket flexibility into account in ligand docking, docking remains a task highly specific to the nature of the receptor. We attempted to formulate a docking protocol which is relatively general and includes both the side­chain sampling and loop movements [3]. This protocol can be further enhanced and generalized if the backbone is sampled according to the relevant normal modes. The ICM docking protocol led to the discovery of novel inhibitors against a number of biomedical targets, including de novo discovery of antagonists of RAR and thyroid hormone receptor ([4]), discovery of inhibitors of alpha1­antitrypsin amyloid formation, discovery of new antimalarial agents. The CAPRI protein docking experiment provides a good platform for evaluation of protein docking algorithms. While a fully reliable prediction of the association geometry given two uncomplexed structures remains unattainable, considerable progress has been made in the last few years [5]. The difficulty of the problem is a function of the scale of the induced conformational changes upon …","pdfUrls":["http://www.soton.ac.uk/~jwe1/pics/talks.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00464000a529faabcc2d076f54a6e2717d4bec33","title":"Accurate Docking of Ligands and Fragments to a Flexible Receptor Solvated Docking: Introducing Water into the Modelling of Biomolecular Complexes","venue":"","year":2006}

Online, external representations take on additional importance because they are also the medium of communication. In this paper I highlight a few important aspects of the roles that external representations can play in the meaning-making activities of two or more participants, and how the particular representation used may influence these activities. I will draw upon my own research for examples. One line of work showed how the properties of representations used to support evidence-based inquiry can affect both discourse activities and student work. A second line of work showed that the distinction between communication tools and other representations is blurred online, with the actual discourse between participants being accomplished by actions in all of the mutable representations. These phenomena are unified by the concept of representational guidance: the constraints, visual properties, and conventions of use associated with representations should be considered in designing to guide learning activities.","pdfUrls":["http://lilt.ics.hawaii.edu/lilt/papers/2003/Suthers-AIED-2003.pdf","http://lilt.ics.hawaii.edu/papers/2003/Suthers-AIED-2003.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0046776df5eb9f160996e7e60d730083eeef5e4d","title":"Representational Guidance for Collaborative Learning","venue":"","year":2003}

Thanks to some factors, we will detail hereafter, these two domains have greatly converged in recent years further to certain factors which we shall detail hereafter. We then outline applications combining GIS and a display technique using AR in order to identify the scientific issues, as well as the functional and technical issues. Starting from this extensive state of the art of existing work, we propose a new functional classification, before concluding with different perspectives. Until recently Augmented Reality (AR) was still seen as a technology used only by researchers in laboratories, but it is now becoming increasingly accessible to a public at large. This technology can be observed according to two different axes: a technological axis and a functional axis. On the one hand, the technological perspective leads us to observe that AR is based on three main pillars. The first pillar corresponds to hardware technologies. Minia-turisation, the multiplication of various different sensors and the increased performance of equipment have enabled this technology to be implemented using many different devices. The second pillar corresponds to software technologies.

Titers of NAb isotypes IgG and IgM binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) in serum were measured at 20, 26, 35, and 45 wk age. Repeated-measure ANOVA showed that IgG and IgM levels vary with time within each breed (P < 0.05). Indigenous chickens had significantly (P < 0.05) higher NAb levels at all ages. The Cox proportional hazard analysis showed increased hazard with increased levels of NAbs in the exotic layers (P < 0.05). However, the reduced hazards with increased levels of NAbs were not significant in the improved indigenous and crossbred chickens. Indigenous chickens showed increased hazard with increasing levels of NAb (P > 0.05). We concluded that not only the NAb levels but also the effect of Nabs on survival vary between indigenous and improved breeds. The results indicate that NAb levels are associated with survival in elite (improved) breeds, but are associated with increased hazard in indigenous chickens.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00486576c80f56a5cdb33119de21ebf30328d797","title":"High natural antibody titers of indigenous chickens are related with increased hazard in confinement","venue":"Poultry science","year":2015}

Thus, the reuse of an existing design in the development of a fault-tolerant version thereof has the potential to reduce the overall development costs. Moreover , the automation of such a reuse yields a fault-tolerant design that is correct by construction, given that the existing design is correct. To facilitate such an automation, we present an approach, where we add three levels of fault-tolerance, namely failsafe, nonmasking, and masking, to functional designs represented as state machines. Intuitively, failsafe fault-tolerance requires that safety specification is met even in the presence of faults. In the presence of faults, nonmasking fault-tolerance guarantees recovery to states from where safety and liveness specifications are satisfied. Masking fault-tolerance stipulates that (i) recovery is provided to states from where safety and liveness specifications are met, and (ii) safety specification is satisfied during such a recovery. Specifically, we present sound and complete deterministic algorithms for automated addition of (failsafe/nonmasking/masking) fault-tolerance to the functional design of concurrent programs. These polynomial-time algorithms are especially useful in model-driven development of fault-tolerant systems, where models are automatically checked and modified. We also discuss (1) the effect of distribution and safety specification model on the complexity of adding fault-tolerance, and (2) the impact of the proposed algorithms on the addition of multitolerance.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cse.msu.edu/~sandeep/publications/ek07SEFT/main.pdf","http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~aebnenas/files/efts07.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0048b3f830f0d61949e74319ef687a23a0d0ee81","title":"Adding Fault-tolerance to State Machine-based Designs","venue":"","year":2007}

Up-regulation of Nkx2.5 expression by desmin suggests that desmin may contribute to cardiogenic commitment and myocardial differentiation by directly influencing the transcription of the nkx2.5 gene in cardiac progenitor cells. Here, we demonstrate that desmin activates transcription of nkx2.5 reporter genes, rescues nkx2.5 haploinsufficiency in cardiac progenitor cells, and is responsible for the proper expression of Nkx2.5 in adult cardiac side population stem cells. These effects are consistent with the temporary presence of desmin in the nuclei of differentiating cardiac progenitor cells and its physical interaction with transcription factor complexes bound to the enhancer and promoter elements of the nkx2.5 gene. These findings introduce desmin as a newly discovered and unexpected player in the regulatory network guiding cardiomyogenesis in cardiac stem cells.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0049e63eb00d2b5cc33622b5a8095389b0839932","title":"Desmin enters the nucleus of cardiac stem cells and modulates Nkx2.5 expression by participating in transcription factor complexes that interact with the nkx2.5 gene","venue":"Biology open","year":2016}

Heat exchangers and heat pipes operate at liquid-vapor saturation. We hypothesize that the wetting behavior of liquid water on microstructures surrounded by pure water vapor differs from that for water droplets in air.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTS\nThe static and dynamic contact angles and contact angle hysteresis of water droplets were measured in air and pure water vapor environments inside a pressure vessel. Pressures ranged from 60 to 1000 mbar, with corresponding saturation temperatures between 36 and 100°C. The wetting behavior was studied on four hydrophobic surfaces: flat Teflon-coated, micropillars, micro-scale meshes, and nanoparticle-coated with hierarchical micro- and nanoscale roughness.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nStatic advancing contact angles are 9° lower in the water vapor environment than in air on a flat surface. One explanation for this reduction in contact angles is water vapor adsorption to the Teflon. On microstructured surfaces, the vapor environment has little effect on the static contact angles. In all cases, variations in pressure and temperature do not influence the wettability and mobility of the water droplets. In most cases, advancing contact angles increase and contact angle hysteresis decreases when the droplets are sliding or rolling down an inclined surface.","pdfUrls":["http://www.scs.illinois.edu/suslick/documents/jcollinterfsci.2015.hydrophobicity.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/004ce49c8b1d4214caacecaea8846c669fec80b5","title":"Impact of air and water vapor environments on the hydrophobicity of surfaces.","venue":"Journal of colloid and interface science","year":2015}

The change of the expression of PKMζ in the ACC was measured by western blot, and the mRNA of PKMζ was detected by quantitative real-time PCR 1, 3, 7 days after experimental tooth movement. The average time spent on mouth-wiping behaviour of rats involved in pain perception was detected. After that a selective PKMζ inhibitor, called myristoylated ζ-pseudosubstrate inhibitory peptide (ZIP) was injected into ACC, and the effects of ZIP were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mouth-wiping behaviour of rats was significantly increased 1, 3, and 7 days after experimental tooth movement. Changes in PKMζ levels were not detected on day 1 but were found to be increased 3 days following the tooth movement, and then declined to the baseline 7 days after tooth movement in the ACC. PKMζ mRNA levels were not significantly different between the experimental and sham-treated groups at the three time points. Time spent on mouth-wiping behaviour was reduced after ZIP was injected into ACC 3 days after tooth movement, and the analgesic effect last for at least 24h.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPKMζ in the ACC acts to maintain the pain induced by experimental tooth movement. Increased expression of PKMζ protein is attributed to persistent translation of PKMζ mRNA. Synaptic plasticity may be involved in the development of tooth movement pain.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/004e735a67cb9c5377807770fc8244b3026f9c49","title":"Up-regulation of PKMζ expression in the anterior cingulate cortex following experimental tooth movement in rats.","venue":"Archives of oral biology","year":2014}

In the present study we used primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons to demonstrate that the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nimodipine, the non-competitive NMDA antagonists dizocilpine and memantine, as well as the AMPA antagonist NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro -7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline), attenuate the glutamate-induced neuronal damage dose-dependently. Nimodipine applied simultaneously with NMDA-antagonists and NBQX, respectively, resulted in somewhat greater neuroprotection of glutamate-treated neurons compared with the effects of these agents applied singly. The type of interaction is best described by an independent action in combination, which means that the relative effects of nimodipine were not enhanced. Therefore, it can be considered as a lack of potentiation.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0050217adffa2c405b0892fc28da996ee1773981","title":"Apparent independent action of nimodipine and glutamate antagonists to protect cultured neurons against glutamate-induced damage.","venue":"Neuropharmacology","year":1996}

A number of works have addressed the problem of what is the best representation for symbolic music in this context. The tree representation, using rhythm for defining the tree structure and pitch information for leaf and node labeling has proven to be effective in melodic similarity computation. In this paper we propose a solution when we have melodies represented by trees for the training but the duration information is not available for the input data. For that, we infer a probabilistic context-free grammar using the information in the trees (duration and pitch) and classify new melodies represented by strings using only the pitch. The case study in this paper is to identify a snippet query among a set of songs stored in symbolic format. For it, the utilized method must be able to deal with inexact queries and efficient for scalability issues.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-21257-4_71","http://grfia.dlsi.ua.es/repositori/grfia/pubs/264/ibpria2011-bernabeu.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose_Inesta/publication/221258608_Classifying_Melodies_Using_Tree_Grammars/links/00463524bdc9c26a29000000.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00505173f758df2cbe8496941160ccc6177312a3","title":"Classifying Melodies Using Tree Grammars","venue":"IbPRIA","year":2011}

Even when the operational uncertainty is omitted under very controlled circumstances during wind tunnel experiments, substantial disagreement between experimental and CFD results persists. This discrepancy must be attributed to model uncertainty. This report discusses the various sources of uncertainty. The need for advanced uncertainty modeling is illustrated by means of a computationally inexpensive 1-D Burgers equation model. We specifically address the uncertainty due to missing variables (inexact or incomplete differential equations). To this extent a random field model is used for the viscosity and the fundamental differences between the solutions of the stochastic differential equations and a simple random variable model is highlighted. The Burgers equation theoretically needs to be integrated over an infinite domain. In a deterministic approach, the integration domain is cut off at some far field boundary. This truncation effectively ignores all variability outside this far field boundary. We present a practical treatment for the uncertainty on the boundary conditions. The results indicate that ignoring the boundary condition uncertainty dramatically underestimates the variance of the velocity ux in the interior of the domain. 1. Introduction & Motivation.

Abstract The purpose of this paper is to examine the role played by built heritages and cultural environments, alongside other locational factors, in explaining the growth of human capital in Sweden. We distinguish between urban, natural and cultural qualities as different sources of regional attractiveness and estimate their influence on the observed growth of individuals with at least three years of higher education during 2001–2010. Neighborhood-level data are used, and unobserved heterogeneity and spatial dependencies are modeled by employing random effects estimations and an instrumental variable approach. Our findings indicate that the local supply of built heritages and cultural environments explain a significant part of human capital growth in Sweden. Results suggest that these types of cultural heritages are important place-based resources with a potential to contribute to improved regional attractiveness and growth.","pdfUrls":["http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1050254/FULLTEXT01.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/005928745b1a6676ed5b99e9de3e9209d98513a7","title":"The role of cultural heritage in attracting skilled individuals","venue":"","year":2016}

BER performance achieved in this paper is better than existing work.","pdfUrls":["http://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume110/number16/19399-0789?format=pdf","http://research.ijcaonline.org/volume110/number16/pxc3900789.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/005a69128a73d41fc252aba1ed28ae64abfcdcd3","title":"A Novel Strategy for Performance Improvement of MISO Wireless System using Alamouti STBC with 4th order FIR Filter","venue":"","year":2015}

Each example consists of the answer to a simple question: how should the rule rank two alternatives, given the positions at which each voter ranks the two alternatives? To be able to formalise this elicitation problem, we develop a novel variant of classical social choice theory in terms of associations of alternatives with vectors of ranks rather than the common associations of voters with preference orders. We then define and study a class of voting rules suited for elicitation using such answers. Finally, we propose and experimentally evaluate several elicitation strategies for arriving at a good approximation of the target rule with a reasonable number of queries.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/978-1-61499-419-0-183","http://www.illc.uva.nl/Research/Publications/Reports/PP-2014-15.text.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/005a973397947110518b26211f9ea57d081be459","title":"Eliciting a Suitable Voting Rule via Examples","venue":"ECAI","year":2014}

The present study sought to establish the prevalence of psychological morbidity in the children of migrant parents from Ireland, and reasons for differences.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData from two British birth cohorts were used for analysis. Each surveyed 17 000 babies born in one week in 1958 and 1970 and followed up through childhood. Validated scales assessed psychological health.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRelative to the rest of the cohort, second-generation Irish children grew up in material hardship and showed greater psychological problems at ages 7, 11 (1958 cohort) and 16 (both cohorts). Adjusting for material adversity and maternal psychological distress markedly reduced differences. Relative to non-Irish parents, Irish-born parents were more likely to report chronic health problems (odds ratio [OR]: 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.54), and Irish-born mothers were more likely to be psychologically distressed (OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.13-1.84, when child was 10). Effect sizes diminished once material adversity was taken into account.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSecond-generation Irish children experienced high levels of psychological morbidity, but this was accounted for through adverse material circumstances in childhood and psychological distress in parents. Public health initiatives focusing on settlement experiences may reduce health inequalities in migrant children.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0061ddb115e107a9f46a32fe1124a7782cbaa5a7","title":"Born into adversity: psychological distress in two birth cohorts of second-generation Irish children growing up in Britain","venue":"Journal of public health","year":2014}

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of MPS among chronic back pain patients, as well as to identify risk factors and the outcome of this disorder.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a prospective observational study involving 126 patients who attended the Pain Management Unit for chronic back pain between 1st January 2009 and 31st December 2009. Data examined included demographic features of patients, duration of back pain, muscle(s) involved, primary diagnosis, treatment modality and response to treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe prevalence of MPS among chronic back pain patients was 63.5% (n = 80). Secondary MPS was more common than primary MPS, making up 81.3% of the total MPS. There was an association between female gender and risk of developing MPS (χ(2) = 5.38, P = 0.02, O.R. = 2.4). Occupation, body mass index and duration of back pain were not significantly associated with MPS occurrence. Repeated measures analysis showed significant changes (P < 0.001) in Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and Modified Oswestry Disability Score (MODS) with standard management during three consecutive visits at six-month intervals.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMPS prevalence among chronic back pain patients was significantly high, with female gender being a significant risk factor. With proper diagnosis and expert management, MPS has a favourable outcome.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/74/68/kjpain-24-100.PMC3111556.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/74/68/Korean_J_Pain_2011_Jun_3_24(2)_100-104.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0063d2110750be91d3e73583cfd18a28b98aa939","title":"Myofascial Pain Syndrome in Chronic Back Pain Patients","venue":"The Korean journal of pain","year":2011}

Using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, both sibs were shown to inherit the same maternal allele from the 11p13 region but different maternal alleles from the 11p15 region. Using a combination of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing techniques, no mutations were identified in the WT1 tumour-suppressor gene from the 11p13 region, but a novel polymorphism was identified in exon 1. mRNA expression studies using the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene, located in 11p15, showed that there was no relaxation of imprinting at this locus. There was also no evidence of loss of heterozygosity on the long arm of chromosome 16. These findings indicate that the WT1 and IGF-II genes, together with the long arm of chromosome 16, are not directly implicated in tumorigenesis in this Wilms family, but that a recombination event has occurred on the short arm of chromosome 11.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/9b/47/Br_J_Cancer_1994_Jun_69(6)_1072-1077.tar.gz","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/9b/47/brjcancer00196-0096.PMC1969446.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/006a950ab9aeb563c33f4fee9e74e256a63cd788","title":"Molecular genetic analysis of chromosome 11p in familial Wilms tumour.","venue":"British journal of cancer","year":1994}

The pathogenesis of the infection results from the sequestration of infected erythrocytes (IRBC) in vital organs, including the brain, with resulting impairment of blood flow, hypoxia, and lactic acidosis. Sequestration occurs through the adhesion of IRBC to host receptors on microvascular endothelium by Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a large family of variant surface antigens, each with up to seven extracellular domains that can bind to multiple host receptors. Consequently, antiadhesive therapies directed at single endothelial adhesion molecules may not be effective. In this study, we demonstrated that the serine protease thrombin, which is pivotal in the activation of the coagulation cascade, cleaved the major parasite adhesin on the surface of IRBC. As a result, adhesion under flow was dramatically reduced, and already adherent IRBC were detached. Thrombin cleavage sites were mapped to the Duffy binding-like δ1 (DBLδ1) domain and interdomains 1 and 2 in the PfEMP1 of the parasite line IT4var19. Furthermore, we observed an inverse correlation between the presence of thrombin and IRBC in cerebral malaria autopsies of children. We investigated a modified (R67A) thrombin and thrombin inhibitor, hirugen, both of which inhibit the binding of substrates to exosite I, thereby reducing its proinflammatory properties. Both approaches reduced the barrier dysfunction induced by thrombin without affecting its proteolytic activity on PfEMP1, raising the possibility that thrombin cleavage of variant PfEMP1 may be exploited as a broadly inhibitory antiadhesive therapy.\n\n\nIMPORTANCE\nPlasmodium falciparum malaria is the third leading cause of mortality due to a pathogen, with 214 million people infected and 438,000 deaths annually. The adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IRBC) to microvascular endothelium is a major pathological process in severe malaria. While the recent implementation of artemisinin-based antimalarial therapy for severe malaria improves patient survival by targeting all parasite stages, antiparasite drugs alone may not immediately reverse pathophysiological processes in occluded vessels. Here we show that thrombin, an enzyme intimately involved in the clotting process, cleaves the main parasite adhesin expressed on the surface of IRBC, thereby preventing and reversing the binding of IRBC to endothelial cells. This beneficial effect of thrombin can be achieved by modified thrombins that cause significantly less clotting and vessel leakage while preserving the ability to cleave the parasite protein. Our results provide the basis for using modified thrombins as adjunctive therapy in severe malaria.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/006be1970974677ec8a2af57a158f6f6724cbc5c","title":"Thrombin Cleavage of Plasmodium falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 Inhibits Cytoadherence","venue":"mBio","year":2016}

During scanning for food birds spot the surroundings mainly with the monocular lateral visual field of the one or other eye and then control pecking with their small binocular frontal visual field. As the visual systems of the avian left and right brain hemisphere are supposed to work largely independently in the short term, the problem arises of how the avian brain handles a task that requires coordinated activity of the left and right brain hemisphere for efficient processing. Here we report that chicks exhibit strong selective feeding when both of the brain hemispheres are involved. With the left or right hemisphere alone selectivity is reduced or completely absent.

Since conventional cardiac Troponin assays have a low sensitivity for diagnosing AMI in the first hours after myocardial necrosis, high-sensitive assays have been developed. The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of a high-sensitive Troponin T assay (hsTnT), alone or combined with the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) assay in comparison with the conventional cardiac Troponin (cTnT) assay for the diagnosis of AMI in patients presenting to the hospital with chest pain.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a cost-utility analysis (quality adjusted life years-QALYs) and a cost effectiveness analysis (life years gained-LYGs) based on a decision analytic model, using a health care perspective in the Dutch context and a life time time-horizon. The robustness of model predictions was explored using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor a life time incremental cost of 30.70 Euros, use of hsTnT over conventional cTnT results in gain of 0.006 Life Years and 0.004 QALY. It should be noted here that hsTnT is a diagnostic intervention which costs only 4.39 Euros/test more than the cTnT test. The ICER generated with the use of hsTnT based diagnostic strategy comparing with the use of a cTnT-based strategy, is 4945 Euros per LYG and 7370 Euros per QALY. The hsTnT strategy has the highest probability of being cost effective at thresholds between 8000 and 20000 Euros per QALY. The combination of hsTnT and h-FABP strategy's probability of being cost effective remains lower than hsTnT at all willingness to pay thresholds.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur analysis suggests that hsTnT assay is a very cost effective diagnostic tool relative to conventional TnT assay. Combination of hsTnT and H-FABP does not offer any additional economic and health benefit over hsTnT test alone.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/54/7d/1471-2261-14-77.PMC4065542.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00705594cee4ed5410c1501a902d506bba0af1de","title":"High-sensitive Troponin T assay for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction: an economic evaluation","venue":"BMC cardiovascular disorders","year":2014}

Cecil Graham: And a sentimentalist, my dear Darlington, is a man who sees an absurd value in everything and doesn't know the market price of any single thing. Now we consider a significant generalization of the maximum-flow problem that cannot be solved by simply modifying the graph and applying a standard flow algorithm. For this problem, every edge e in the input graph has both a capacity c(e) and a cost $(e). The cost function describes the cost of sending a unit of flow through the edges; thus, the cost any flow f is defined as follows: $(f) = e∈E $(e) · f (e). Costs can either be positive, negative, or zero. The minimum-cost flow problem is to compute a feasible flow with minimum cost, instead of a feasible flow with maximum value. Standard reductions: • Reduce maximum flow to min-cost circulation: add ts with cost −1 and infinite capacity, and give all other edges cost 0. • Reduce min-cost flow (with arbitrary vertex balances) to minimum-cost circulation: Find a feasible flow and work in the residual graph. Most natural formulation for cycle canceling. • Reduce min-cost flow to transportation—non-trivial vertex balances, non-negative costs, infinite capacities, zero lower bounds. Replace each edge e with two edges; move upper and lower bounds to balances on vertices. Most natural formulation for successive shortest path. Without loss of generality, it suffices to consider the minimum-cost circulation problem, where the network has no specified source or target, and we seek a minimum-cost flow with value 0. For flow networks with a source s and target t, we can reduce to the minimum-cost circulation problem by adding a single edge ts with infinite capacity and cost 0. For flow networks with nontrivial balance constraints at the vertices, we first find a feasible flow f using the algorithm in the previous section and then seek a minimum-cost circulation in the residual graph G f.

A bound on the worst-case parameter estimation error is derived. This bound shows that the worst-case parameter estimation error decreases to zero as the bound on the noise is decreased to zero. 1. Introduction THE LEAST SQUARES ALGORITHM, due to Gauss, is one of the most widely used algorithms in science. It has been extensively studied and used for parametric system identification-see, for example, the book by Ljung (1987). It is very well known that the least squares algorithm enjoys certain optimality properties under suitable stochastic assumptions about exogeneous noise. In contrast, some recent papers have taken a worst-case deterministic approach to identification. See the recent paper by Khargonekar (1993) for a discussion of this general area and an extensive list of references. In particular, our work is most closely related to the work on time-domain worst-case identification problems (Chen et al. and the references cited in these papers). Our work has grown out of a need to make connections between the classical identification theory and the more recent work in the area of robust identification. Towards this goal, in this paper we have investigated the performance of the least squares algorithm in the presence of worst-case bounded noise. In the result of this paper, we derive a bound on the worst-case parameter estimation error using the least squares algorithm in the presence of arbitrary bounded noise. This error bound shows that if the input is chosen to be a pseudorandom binary sequence, the worst-case parameter estimation error decreases to zero as the noise bound decreases to zero. In the terminology introduced by Helmicki et al. (1991), the least squares algorithm is robustly convergent. [We note that there is an important technical difference between the notion of robust convergence used in this paper and that in Heimicki et al. (1991).] While the problem formulation is motivated from the deterministic worst-case identification theory, the techniques employed in this paper draw upon the results in classical identification theory (Ljung, 1987).

A cold pressor test was performed ten minutes after initiation of stimulation. Pain threshold and tolerance were defined as time latencies to the onset of pain perception and to the withdrawal from cold stimulus, respectively. Furthermore, pain intensity (on a scale from 0 to 10) was rated at tolerance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTime latencies to pain threshold and tolerance were altered by the type of stimulation (p < 0.05). Pairwise post hoc analysis revealed that anodal tDCS led to increment in pain threshold and tolerance compared with sham stimulation (13.3 ± 7.4 vs. 10.9 ± 6.0 sec for the comparison of pain threshold and 54.6 ± 26.0 vs. 45.3 ± 17.9 for the comparison of pain tolerance following anodal and sham stimulations, respectively, p < 0.05 for both comparisons). However, cathodal stimulation did not alter pain perception in comparison to anodal and sham stimulations (p > 0.05). Furthermore, pain intensity score at tolerance was not significantly affected by the type of stimulation (p > 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAnodal stimulation of the primary motor area can be utilized to alleviate cold pain perception in healthy individuals.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/007426c134f763ddd09bb11a37208dcf39b5bde4","title":"Modulation of cold pain perception by transcranial direct current stimulation in healthy individuals.","venue":"Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society","year":2013}

Lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), a sensitive biomarker of impaired health status in this organism, was assessed in the digestive glands. In addition, oxidative stress markers and the expression of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in antioxidant defense (catalase (cat) and glutathione-S-transferase (gst)) and the heat shock response (hsp90, hsp70, and hsp27) were evaluated in the gills, the target tissue of soluble chemicals. Finally, cAMP levels, which represent an important cell signaling pathway related to oxidative stress and the response to temperature challenges, were also determined in the gills. Exposure to heat stress as well as to OTC rendered a decrease in LMS and an increase in malonedialdehyde accumulation (MDA). CAT activity was not significantly modified, whereas GST activity decreased at 24°C. Cat and gst expression levels were reduced in animals kept at 24°C compared to 16°C in the presence or absence of OTC. At 16°C, treatment with OTC caused a significant increase in cat and gst transcript levels. Hsp27 mRNA was significantly up-regulated at all conditions compared to controls at 16°C. cAMP levels were increased at 24°C independent of the presence of OTC. PCA analysis showed that 37.21% and 25.89% of the total variance was explained by temperature and OTC treatment, respectively. Interestingly, a clear interaction was observed in animals exposed to both stressors increasing LMS and MDA accumulation and reducing hsp27 gene expression regulation. These interactions may suggest a risk for the organisms due to temperature increases in contaminated seawaters.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0074fc4216ffcf71138d7d0d0582d06ff2847d12","title":"Molecular and Cellular Effects Induced in Mytilus galloprovincialis Treated with Oxytetracycline at Different Temperatures","venue":"PloS one","year":2015}

Handover becomes one of the major problems in such a mobile environment as it is of utmost importance to provide a higher guarantee that the users are able to continue their service during the entire length of the transmission, without it being blocked during the handover or loss of quality or data. Careful dimensioning of the network and the underlying teletraffic analysis plays a major role in determining the various Grade of Service (GoS) parameters that service providers can provide at various network loads. The channel holding time of a cell is one of the major parameters that needs to be accurately modelled in the teletraffic analysis. This paper focuses on using Phase-type distributions of Generalised Erlang form to model channel holding time in a mobile environment. We also present the Quasi-Birth-Death process, which characterises the queuing models with Generalised Erlang service and exponential interarrival distributions. Further we investigate the use of channels exclusively reserved for handover users to improve the handover performance.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2001.936979","http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/david.green/Papers/PH_service.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00778656a05c922baa02f2086a147aeff8243300","title":"Modelling service time distribution in cellular networks using phase-type service distributions","venue":"ICC","year":2001}

In this study we have investigated the cerebral perfusion patterns at rest in ESRD patients on hemodialysis, compared with those in healthy volunteers. We have also studied the brain responses evoked by experimental itch induction in ESRD, after stimulating the two distinct histamine and cowhage itch pathways, and compared them with the responses evoked in healthy volunteers. To identify potential structural alterations in ESRD patients compared with a group of age-matched healthy volunteers, we calculated the density of gray matter for the entire brain using a voxel-based morphometric analysis. Our results indicated that gray matter density was significantly reduced in ESRD patients in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices, as well as in the S1, precuneus, and insula, whereas the brain stem, hippocampus, amygdala, midcingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens displayed an increased gray matter density. Functionally, we found a significantly higher brain perfusion at baseline associated with ESRD pruritus in the anterior cingulate, insula, claustrum, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens. The brain responses evoked by cowhage itch, which are mediated by protease-activated receptors (PAR2), displayed significant differences compared with responses in healthy individuals and were correlated with perceived itch intensity in a dual, complex manner. The inverse correlations in particular suggested that a negative feedback mechanism modulated itch intensity, when elicited in a preexistent chronic itch background.","pdfUrls":["http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/112/7/1729.full.pdf","http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/early/2014/06/13/jn.00827.2013.full.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/007ab026c1427323d4d59b9a35d7cfa6717aa8fd","title":"Voxel-based morphometry and arterial spin labeling fMRI reveal neuropathic and neuroplastic features of brain processing of itch in end-stage renal disease.","venue":"Journal of neurophysiology","year":2014}

The goal is to replace single horn feeds with a phased array feed, so as to enable astronomers to cover more sky area in less time. The development of digital backend signal processing systems has been a major area of concentration for the development of science-ready phased array feeds for radio astronomers. This thesis focuses on the development of analog down-converter receivers and an FPGA-based digital backend for real-time data processing and analysis support for phased array feeds. Experiments were conducted with new receiver boards and both single-polarization and dual-polarization phased array feeds at the Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico and at the 20-meter telescope at Green Bank, WV, and results were analyzed. The experiments were performed as a part of a feasibility study for phased array feeds. The new receiver boards were developed as an upgrade to the earlier connectorized receivers as the number of input channels increased from 19 to 38 and space constraints arose due to the large size of the earlier receivers. Each receiver card has four independent channels on it. The receiver cards were found to have lower cross-coupling between the channels in comparison to the earlier receivers. The development of a FPGA-based real time digital backend focused on a real-time spectrometer , beamformer and a correlator for all the 64-channels using a x64 ADC card and ROACH FPGA boards. The backend can plot results in real time and can stream and store the data on the computers for purpose of post-processing and data analysis. The design process uses libraries and blocks provided by the Center for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER) community.

Most of the well-known CASE-tools nowadays support reverse engineering in some way. But although the Unified Modeling Language (UML) has emerged as the de facto standard for the abstract graphical representation of object-oriented software systems, there does not yet exist a standard scheme for representing the reverse engineered models of software systems. Due to the differences in understanding and application of the UML notation and the proprietary extensions that different tools adopt, it is often difficult to ensure that model semantics remains un-ambiguous when working with different tools at the same time. In this paper, we examine the capabilities of the two most successful industrial-strength CASE-tools in reverse engineering the static structure of software systems and compare them to the results produced by two academic prototypes. The comparisons are carried out both manually and automatically using a research prototype for manipulating and comparing UML models.","pdfUrls":["http://www.se.eecs.uni-kassel.de/se/fileadmin/se/publications/KSSSZ02.pdf","http://www.db.informatik.uni-bremen.de/publications/Kollmann_2002_WCRE.ps.gz","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/WCRE.2002.1173061","http://cs.gmu.edu/~duminda/classes/spring04/State_Of_Art.pdf","http://www.ise.gmu.edu/~duminda/classes/spring04/State_Of_Art.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/007c8811c5db9090a51473f0c301e204616cf610","title":"A Study on the Current State of the Art in Tool-Supported UML-Based Static Reverse Engineering","venue":"WCRE","year":2002}

The biological function of this post-translational modification has remained enigmatic. 3-nitro-L-tyrosine (nitrotyrosine, NO(2)Tyr), can be incorporated into detyrosinated alpha-tubulin instead of tyrosine, producing irreversibly nitrotyrosinated alpha-tubulin. To gain insight into the possible function of detyrosination, the effect of NO(2)Tyr has been assessed in two plant model organisms (rice and tobacco). NO(2)Tyr causes a specific, sensitive, and dose-dependent inhibition of cell division that becomes detectable from 1 h after treatment and which is not observed with non-nitrosylated tyrosine. These effects are most pronounced in cycling tobacco BY-2 cells, where the inhibition of cell division is accompanied by a stimulation of cell length, and a misorientation of cross walls. NO(2)Tyr reduces the abundance of the detyrosinated form of alpha-tubulin whereas the tyrosinated alpha-tubulin is not affected. These findings are discussed with respect to a model where NO(2)Tyr is accepted as substrate by TTL and subsequently blocks TTC activity. The irreversibly tyrosinated alpha-tubulin impairs microtubular functions that are relevant to cell division in general, and cell wall deposition in particular.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/2b/7d/J_Exp_Bot_2010_Mar_16_61(3)_901-909.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/007ddf8ba36efa378f5488863484e2fddb386be8","title":"Plant cell division is specifically affected by nitrotyrosine","venue":"Journal of experimental botany","year":2010}

Basolateral amygdala is crucial for COA learning but its importance in COA consolidation remains to be demonstrated. We investigated whether infusion of anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, in the basolateral amygdala impaired COA consolidation. COA was greatly impaired when anisomycin was infused immediately before odor-malaise pairing, but not between odor and malaise. This suggests that the formation of odor representation, rather than malaise integration, within the amygdala has been disrupted. Anisomycin infusion before acquisition did not affect short-term memory (tested 4 h after odor-malaise pairing) but dramatically impaired long-term COA memory (tested 3 days later). This indicates specific consolidation impairment. Control experiments indicated that anisomycin infusion did not affect amygdala functionality and olfactory perception and did not induce cell death in the amygdala. Moreover, anisomycin treatment induced an important decrease (65-70%) of LiCl-induced Fos protein expression in the basolateral and the central nuclei of the amygdala but not in adjacent piriform cortex indicating a reliable and localized protein synthesis inhibition. These findings suggest the pivotal role of the basolateral amygdala, and possibly the central amygdala, in COA memory consolidation.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/008619a86436aaadff654fbe382108245a112a4a","title":"Anisomycin infusion in amygdala impairs consolidation of odor aversion memory.","venue":"Brain research","year":2008}

Based on correlations between audiometric measures of aged patients and histologic findings garnered from postmortem examinations, four types of presbycusis have been characterized: sensory-neural, neural, strial, and conductive [Schuknecht, H.F., Gacek, M.R., 1993. Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. 102, 1--16]. Otopathologic changes to the inner ear as a direct function of age, however, remain controversial. The focus of this investigation involves the pathological impact on remaining sensory structures in patients having sensory--neural degeneration. The current study presents seven human temporal bones extracted from patients aged 53--67 years with high-tone hearing loss and with no known history of extraordinary environmental events involving head or noise trauma, acoustic overstimulation, or ototoxicity. In previously published findings of these specimens, all but one temporal bone failed to demonstrate a meaningful correlation between audiometric measurements and loss of functional hair cell populations with secondary retrograde degeneration of nerve fibers. Using the block surface method, electron microscopic micrographs demonstrate ultrastructural changes in the cuticular plate, stereocilia, pillar cells, stria vascularis, and the spiral ligament. In all pathological specimens, the greatest incidence of degeneration was seen at the cuticular plate. Conclusively, our findings present three implications in the aging human cochlea: firstly, audiometric measures that represent a high-tone hearing loss may take various forms with respect to ultrastructural patterns of degeneration and surviving structures; secondly, the incidence of lipofuscin and lysosome granules does not correlate with the degree of hearing loss and; thirdly, as shown only in guinea pigs [Anniko, M., 1988. Scanning Microsc. 2, 1035--1041], high-tone hearing loss can be associated with deformation of the cuticular plate.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/008671f99531241b71dbe165dbc4c59c1eec1d1b","title":"Selective aspects of human pathology in high-tone hearing loss of the aging inner ear.","venue":"Hearing research","year":2001}

HTLV-2 is considered ancestral in the Americas and is transmitted to the general population and injection drug users from the indigenous population. In the Americas, HTLV-1 has more than one origin, being brought by immigrants in the Paleolithic period through the Bering Strait, through slave trade during the colonial period, and through Japanese immigration from the early 20th century, whereas HTLV-2 was only brought by immigrants through the Bering Strait. The endemicity of HTLV-2 among the indigenous people of Brazil makes the Brazilian Amazon the largest endemic area in the world for its occurrence. A review of HTLV-1 in all Brazilian tribes supports the African origin of HTLV-1 in Brazil.

This question is addressed in [2]. Here we report on old and new developments. There are several construction methods for nonisomorphic cospectral graphs, and it is known that for almost all trees there exists another tree with the same spectrum (see [5]). However, the fractions of graphs on n vertices for which such a cospectral mate is known tends to 0 if n → ∞. On the other hand, it is difficult to show for a given graph G that there exists no graph nonisomorphic but cospectral with G. Such a graph is called DS (determined by its spectrum). Several special graphs are proven to be DS. This includes the complete graphs K n , the regular complete bipartite graphs K k,k (note that the above example gives a counter example for a nonregular complete bipartite graph), the cycles and the line graphs of K k,k and K n provided k = 4, n = 8. A typical proof of such a spectral characterization goes in two steps. First one obtains structural properties from the spectrum and then it is shown that these properties determine the graph. For distance-regular graphs (DRG's for short) this approach is very suitable. First one needs to prove that a graph with the spectrum of a DRG is a DRG, and in the second step one needs to show that the DRG is uniquely determined by its parameters (intersection array). For many DRG's the second step is given in [1]. Here the game is to take a known DRG, and try to find a nonisomorphic cospectral mate, or show that it does not exist.

An important data mining task is to find interesting groups of objects that form clusters in subspaces of the data sources jointly supported by those data sources. In this paper, we study a novel problem of mining mutual subspace clusters from multiple sources. We develop two interesting models and the corresponding methods for mutual subspace clustering. The density-based model identifies dense regions in subspaces as clusters. The bottom-up method searches for density-based mutual subspace clusters systematically from low-dimensional subspaces to high-dimensional ones. The partitioning model divides points in a data set into k exclusive clusters and a signature subspace is found for each cluster, where k is the number of clusters desired by a user. The top-down method interleaves the well-known k-means clustering procedures in multiple sources. We use experimental results on synthetic data sets and real data sets to report the effectiveness and the efficiency of the methods. In many applications, there are multiple data sources. It is important to analyze data using the multiple data sources in an integrative way. 1.1. Motivation application examples and challenges To develop effective therapies for cancers, both clinical data and genomic data have been accumulated for cancer patients. Examining clinical data or genomic data independently may not reveal the inherent patterns and correlations present in both data sets. Therefore, it is important to integrate clinical and genomic data and mining knowledge from both data sources. 1 Clustering is a powerful tool for uncovering underlying patterns without requiring much prior knowledge about data. To discover phenotypes of cancer, subspace clustering has been widely used to analyze such data. However, in order to understand the clusters on clinical attributes well, and find out the genomic explanations, it is highly desirable to find clusters that are manifested in subspaces in both the clinical attributes and the genomic attributes. For a cluster mutual in a clinical subspace and a genomic subspace, we can use the genomic attributes to verify and justify the clinical attributes. The mutual clusters are more understandable and more robust. In addition, mutual subspace clustering is also helpful in integrating multiple sources. As another example, consider cross-market customer relationship management. Customer behaviors in multiple markets (e.g., financial planning and investment, vacation expenditure, reading, entertainment and leisure expense) can be …","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~jpei/publications/MutualClustering.pdf","https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~jpei/publications/MutualClustering.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2011.08.032"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/008ea97d145202a469113171bfbfeb53b894b6cd","title":"Clustering in applications with multiple data sources - A mutual subspace clustering approach","venue":"Neurocomputing","year":2012}

The probabilistic approach that we use makes the proposed method capable of adaptively detect and localize network faults by the use of simple end-to-end test transactions. Our method operates in a fully distributed manner, such that each network element detects faults using locally extracted information as input. This allows for a fast autonomous adaption to local network conditions in real-time, with significantly reduced need for manual configuration of algorithm parameters. Initial results from a small synthetically generated network indicate that satisfactory algorithm performance can be achieved, with respect to the number of detected and localized faults, detection time and false alarm rate.","pdfUrls":["http://eprints.sics.se/3601/1/SICS-T--2009-07--SE.pdf","http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1037849/FULLTEXT01.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/008f45118e17f04faf30fe1c826b010b759ae3f7","title":"An Initial Approach to Distributed Adaptive Fault-handling in Networked Systems","venue":"","year":2009}

The organization and regulation of these components in the pursuit of life constitute the fundamental nature of the cell. Thus, regulation sits at the heart of biological knowledge of the cell and the extraordinary complexity of this regulation conditions the kind of knowledge that can be obtained, in particular, the representation and intelligibility of that knowledge. This paper is essentially split into two parts. The first part discusses the inadequacy of everyday intelligibility and intuition in science and the consequent need for scientific theories to be expressed mathematically without appeal to commonsense categories of understanding, such as causality. Having set the backdrop, the second part addresses biological knowledge. It briefly reviews modern scientific epistemology from a general perspective and then turns to the epistemology of the cell. In analogy with a multi-faceted factory, the cell utilizes a highly parallel distributed control system to maintain its organization and regulate its dynamical operation in the face of both internal and external changes. Hence, scientific knowledge is constituted by the mathematics of stochastic dynamical systems, which model the overall relational structure of the cell and how these structures evolve over time, stochasticity being a consequence of the need to ignore a large number of factors while modeling relatively few in an extremely complex environment.","pdfUrls":["http://gsp.tamu.edu/Publications/epistemology-papers/causality-randomness-intelligibility-and-the-epistemology-of-the-cell/files/cg_cell.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/ea/bd/Curr_Genomics_2010_Jun_11(4)_221-237.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0092a97a45ca9dcc8601f61dac181ef3add5afd7","title":"Causality, Randomness, Intelligibility, and the Epistemology of the Cell","venue":"Current genomics","year":2010}

Treatment response prediction will help in reducing the patients who suffer from the side effects and high costs without achieving recovery. The aim of this research is to develop a framework which can select the best model to predict HCV patients' response to the treatment of HCV from clinical information. The framework contains three phases which are preprocessing phase to prepare the data for applying Data Mining (DM) techniques, DM phase to apply different DM techniques, and evaluation phase to evaluate and compare the performance of the built models and select the best model as the recommended one. Different DM techniques had been applied which are associative classification, artificial neural network, and decision tree to evaluate the framework. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of the framework in selecting the best model which is the model built by associative classification using histology activity index, fibrosis stage, and alanine amino transferase.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/181056"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0094757e31da4197e1a15d8138f1fe4df447b9d9","title":"A Framework for Prediction of Response to HCV Therapy Using Different Data Mining Techniques","venue":"Adv.

Reorganizations and downsizing with increased workload imply stress for health-care professionals. This is a study of burnout in nurses during a period with two comprehensive reorganizations.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this quasi-experimental retrospective cohort study, burnout was assessed in nurses with long work experience in three surveys during a 30 months' period with two comprehensive reorganizations and downsizing of a hospital unit with mostly seriously ill patients with cancer. Burnout was measured with Bergen Burnout Indicator (BBI) at each survey, and \"Sense of Coherence\" (SOC) with Antonovsky's questionnaire at the last survey.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne man and 45 women aged 30 to 65 years were invited to the surveys. There was a significant increase in burnout during the study period, the mean increase in BBI-score was 12.5 pr year (p < 0.001). The proportion of satisfied nurses at the first and last survey were 84% and 35% respectively, and the proportions with burnout were 0% and 29% respectively (p < 0.001). Except for auxiliary nurses with experience from the medical department, all subgroups experienced a significant increase in BBI. Burnout was associated with low SOC (p < 0.001, r square 0.33).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere was a significant development of burnout in a group of nurses during a period with two reorganizations and downsizing. Burnout was associated with low SOC. Working with seriously ill patients with cancer has probably made the nurses exceptionally vulnerable to the stress and workload related to the reorganizations.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/01/36/BMC_Nurs_2010_Jun_4_9_8.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00983eafea99632307853fe67c6fcdb6d0cf7641","title":"Burnout in health-care professionals during reorganizations and downsizing.

Under normal circumstances, the expression of aromatase in the central nervous system of mammals is restricted to neurons. However, the expression of the enzyme is induced in astrocytes in vitro by stressful stimuli. Furthermore, different types of brain injury induce in vivo the expression of aromatase in reactive astrocytes. The expression of aromatase by reactive astrocytes is neuroprotective, because the pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme in the brain exacerbates neuronal death after different forms of mild neurodegenerative stimuli that do not significantly affect neuronal survival under control conditions. These findings indicate that the induction of aromatase in reactive astrocytes, and the consecutive increase in the local production of estradiol in the brain at injured sites, may be an endogenous neural response to reduce the extent of neurodegenerative damage.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/009bcd402806a1167d46e1029072e3a9369efaf1","title":"Aromatase expression by reactive astroglia is neuroprotective.","venue":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","year":2003}

By the drug repositioning strategy, we confirmed that perhexiline maleate (Pex) potentially ameliorates heterotopic ossification in model cells and mice. Here, we conducted a prospective study to assess the efficacy and safety of Pex in the treatment of FOP patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFOP patients in this open-label single-center study were treated with Pex for a total of 12 months, and followed up for 12 consecutive months after medication discontinuation. The safety of the treatment was assessed regularly by physical and blood examinations. The efficacy of Pex for preventing heterotopic ossifications was evaluated by the presence of flare-ups, measurements of serum bone markers, and changes in the total bone volume calculated by the three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) images.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive patients with an average age of 23.4 years were enrolled. Within safe doses of Pex administration in each individual, there were no drug-induced adverse effects during the medication phase. Three patients showed no intense inflammatory reactions during the study period, while two patients had acute flare-ups around the hip joint without evidence of trauma during the medication phase. In addition, one of them became progressively incapable of opening her mouth over the discontinuation phase. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone specific ALP (BAP) were significantly and synchronously increased with the occurrence of flare-ups. Volumetric 3D-CT analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the total bone volume of Case 2 (378 cm(3)) and Case 3 (833 cm(3)) during the two-year study period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe could not prove the efficacy of oral Pex administration in the prevention of heterotopic ossifications in FOP.

Although mosquitoes are an important vector for diverse pathogens, with the exception of members of the genus Wolbachia little is known about their role in the transmission of Rickettsiales. Herein, Rickettsiales were identified by PCR in five species of mosquitoes (Anopheles sinensis, Armigeres subalbatus, Aedes albopictus, Culex quinquefasciatus and Cu. tritaeniorhynchus) collected from three Chinese provinces during 2014-2015. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses of the rrs, groEL and gltA genes revealed the presence of Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Candidatus Neoehrlichia, and Rickettsia bacteria in mosquitoes, comprising nine documented and five tentative species bacteria, as well as three symbionts/endosybionts. In addition, bacteria were identified in mosquito eggs, larvae, and pupae sampled from aquatic environments. Hence, these data suggest that Rickettsiales circulate widely in mosquitoes in nature. Also of note was that Ehrlichia and Rickettsia bacteria were detected in each life stage of laboratory cultured mosquitoes, suggesting that Rickettsiales may be maintained in mosquitoes through both transstadial and transovarial transmission. In sum, these data indicate that mosquitoes may have played an important role in the transmission and evolution of Rickettsiales in nature.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00ac92d7a13da240553398a59d8826e02847acca","title":"Extensive genetic diversity of Rickettsiales bacteria in multiple mosquito species","venue":"Scientific reports","year":2016}

Typical implementations rely on speculation and rollback, but this creates problems for irreversible operations like interactive I/O. A widely assumed solution allows a transaction to operate in an inevitable mode that excludes all other transactions and is guaranteed to complete, but this approach does not scale. This paper explores a richer set of alternatives for software TM, and demonstrates that it is possible for an inevitable transaction to run in parallel with (non-conflicting) non-inevitable transactions, without introducing significant overhead in the non-inevitable case. We report experience with these alternatives in a graphical game application. We also consider the use of inevitability to accelerate certain common-case transactions.","pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICPP.2008.55","http://ftp.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/papers/2008_icpp_inevitability.pdf","http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/papers/2008_icpp_inevitability.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Spear/publication/232655929_Implementing_and_Exploiting_Inevitability_in_Software_Transactional_Memory/links/00b49525db4bd79c26000000.pdf","http://cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/papers/2008_icpp_inevitability.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00aee6e171c40e54ec7eb2240192820871ca5ded","title":"Implementing and Exploiting Inevitability in Software Transactional Memory","venue":"ICPP","year":2008}

Since then, a number of stomatin-like proteins have been identified in all three domains of life. The conservation among these proteins is remarkable, with bacterial and human homologs sharing 50 % identity. Despite being associated with a variety of diseases such as cancer, kidney failure and anaemia, precise functions of these proteins remain unclear.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe have constructed a comprehensive phylogeny of all 'stomatin-like' sequences that share a 150 amino acid domain. We show these proteins comprise an ancient family that arose early in prokaryotic evolution, and we propose a new nomenclature that reflects their phylogeny, based on the name \"slipin\" (stomatin-like protein). Within prokaryotes there are two distinct subfamilies that account for the two different origins of the eight eukaryotic stomatin subfamilies, one of which gave rise to eukaryotic SLP-2, renamed here \"paraslipin\". This was apparently acquired through the mitochondrial endosymbiosis and is widely distributed amongst the major kingdoms. The other prokaryotic subfamily gave rise to the ancestor of the remaining seven eukaryotic subfamilies. The highly diverged \"alloslipin\" subfamily is represented only by fungal, viral and ciliate sequences. The remaining six subfamilies, collectively termed \"slipins\", are confined to metazoa. Protostome stomatin, as well as a newly reported arthropod subfamily slipin-4, are restricted to invertebrate groups, whilst slipin-1 (previously SLP-1) is present in nematodes and higher metazoa. In vertebrates, the stomatin family expanded considerably, with at least two duplication events giving rise to podocin and slipin-3 subfamilies (previously SLP-3), with the retained ancestral sequence giving rise to vertebrate stomatin.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nStomatin-like proteins have their origin in an ancient duplication event that occurred early on in the evolution of prokaryotes. By constructing a phylogeny of this family, we have identified and named a number of orthologous groups: these can now be used to infer function of stomatin subfamilies in a meaningful way.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/91/3c/1471-2148-8-44.PMC2258279.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00af9dead819f891af6344abbcae2f98da45ebf8","title":"Slipins: ancient origin, duplication and diversification of the stomatin protein family","venue":"BMC evolutionary biology","year":2008}

We hypothesized that CGRP infusion would increase molecular markers of neuronal activation in migraine-relevant tissues of the rat.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCGRP was infused intravenously (i.v.) in freely moving rats to circumvent factors like anesthesia, acute surgery and severe hypotension, the three confounding factors for c-Fos expression. The trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) was isolated at different time points after CGRP infusion. The level of c-Fos mRNA and protein expression in TNC were analyzed by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. c-Fos-stained nuclei were also counted in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), integrative sites in the brain stem for processing cardiovascular signals. We also investigated Zif268 protein expression (another immediate early gene) in TNC. The protein expression of p-ERK, p-CREB and c-Fos was analyzed in dura mater, trigeminal ganglion (TG) and TNC samples using Western blot.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCGRP infusion caused a significant dose-dependent fall in mean arterial blood pressure. No significant activation of c-Fos in the TNC at mRNA and protein levels was observed after CGRP infusion. A significant increase in c-Fos protein was observed in the NTS and CVLM in the brain stem. Zif268 expression in the TNC was also not changed after CGRP infusion. p-ERK was increased in the dura mater 30 minutes after CGRP infusion.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCGRP infusion increased the early expression of p-ERK in the dura mater but did not increase c-Fos and Zif268 expression in the TNC. The rats may, thus, differ from migraine patients, in whom infusion of CGRP caused headache and a delayed migraine attack. The rat CGRP infusion model with c-Fos or Zif268 as neuronal pain markers in TNC is unsuitable for antimigraine drug testing.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00b00c91865c1705e8d052964ff7da7cd9c54c6d","title":"CGRP infusion in unanesthetized rats increases expression of c-Fos in the nucleus tractus solitarius and caudal ventrolateral medulla, but not in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis.","venue":"Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache","year":2015}

To facilitate such MBR-based streaming services, a mechanism is required to support seamless switching among multiple bit-streams when a bandwidth change is detected. The SP-frames developed in H.264 provide such a mechanism at each pre-selected switching point. In this paper, we propose a new switching scheme that is based on a wavelet-domain processing of the reconstructed frame at each switching point. We will compare our scheme with the SP-frame scheme in aspects such as the quality drop at each switching point and all subsequent frames, the count of overhead bits to support an arbitrary switching, and the computational complexity. The results indicate that our scheme can achieve the seamless switching with a better rate-distortion performance at cost of slightly increasing the computations at the decoder side.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cecs.uci.edu/~papers/icme06/pdfs/0001849.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICME.2006.262914"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00b3d9551d24b4663146802f1423ac4fbab32b47","title":"Seamless Switching in Multi-Rate Video Streaming Systems: A Wavelet-Based Scheme Versus the SP-Frame Scheme","venue":"ICME","year":2006}

High-intensity signals in the cortex and subcortical regions were similar in number and proportions among all groups, even when hypertensive patients were excluded. No correlations to cognitive or psychiatric state were found. Periventricular signals were categorized using a 1- (absent) to 6- (thick, irregular caps and stripes) point scale. The categories were similar among groups except that patients with AD exhibited more category 5 changes than did normal subjects, neuropsychological performance was significantly worse in patients with AD who had category 5 and 6 changes when compared to those in category 1. These results suggest that periventricular changes may predict poor neuropsychological performance in patients with AD. However, neither deep white-matter lesions nor periventricular changes are useful for diagnostic purposes.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00bc6c6c374a8b35733a14bfed58401909ee4fb7","title":"The relationship of high-intensity signals on magnetic resonance images to cognitive and psychiatric state in Alzheimer's disease.","venue":"Archives of neurology","year":1991}

present an approach to teach incrementally human gestures to a humanoid robot. By using active teaching methods that puts the human teacher \"in the loop\" of the robot's learning, we show that the essential characteristics of a gesture can be efficiently transferred by interacting socially with the robot. In a first phase, the robot observes the user demonstrating the skill while wearing motion sensors. The motion of his/her two arms and head are recorded by the robot, projected in a latent space of motion and encoded bprobabilistically in a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In a second phase, the user helps the robot refine its gesture by kinesthetic teaching, i.e. by grabbing and moving its arms throughout the movement to provide the appropriate scaffolds. To update the model of the gesture, we compare the performance of two incremental training procedures against a batch training procedure. We present experiments to show that different modalities can be combined efficiently to teach incrementally basketball officials' signals to a HOAP-3 humanoid robot.","pdfUrls":["http://www.calinon.ch/papers/Calinon-HRI2007.pdf","http://lasa.epfl.ch/publications/uploadedFiles/Calinon-HRI2007.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sylvain_Calinon/publication/221473287_Incremental_learning_of_gestures_by_imitation_in_a_humanoid_robot/links/0fcfd50f9952839fc7000000.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1228716.1228751"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00bdefcfe6ab3fa1b9ac5dc029ef3f3cb9db25e1","title":"Incremental learning of gestures by imitation in a humanoid robot","venue":"HRI","year":2007}

A special focus was put on the reasons accounting for successful medication adherence and on potential barriers or facilitating factors.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA qualitative study with semi-structured interviews was conducted. Eighteen participants were recruited through stratified purposive sampling according to their medication adherence level. Interviews were analysed by interpretative phenomenological analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMedication adherence behaviour was described on a continuum ranging from non-adherent to adherent. Participants' current adherence level was represented as a result of inner negotiations between a variety of influential factors and the successful application of a range of strategies. The influential factors were: experiences with medication, outcome expectations, knowledge of therapeutic options, the traits 'openness' and 'conscientiousness', belief in medical progress, characteristics of the medication, level of trust in one's physician, and perceived autonomy. Facilitating strategies were: establishing routines, using social support and the deliberate suppression of information about potential adverse events.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe experience of and the reasons for medication (non-)adherence from the perspective of people with RA were explored comprehensively. Participants' ongoing negotiations between adherence and non-adherence emerged as a key finding with implications for health service providers.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00bedc1dd3c95cc65995f7faf1c4c861ff75d051","title":"'The lesser of two evils…' - views of persons with rheumatoid arthritis on medication adherence: a qualitative study.","venue":"Psychology & health","year":2016}

We show that spline functions can be constructed naturally from the control theory. By establishing a framework based on control theory, we provide a simple and systematic way to construct splines. We have constructed the traditional spline functions including the polynomial splines and the classical exponential spline. We have also discovered some new spline functions such as the combination of polynomial, exponential and trigonometric splines. The method proposed in this paper is easy to implement. Some numerical experiments are performed to investigate properties of diierent spline approximations.","pdfUrls":["http://www.math.wayne.edu/~zzhang/paper/ztm.ps"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00c12eeb2e7be1dcde9c88af66901ea87cd2f635","title":"Splines and Linear Control Theory","venue":"","year":1997}

Clinical and angiographic results seem promising, however, data on its immediate procedural performance are still scarce. The aim of our study was to assess the mechanical properties of BVS by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) in clinical routine.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPost-implantation OCT images of 40 BVS were retrospectively compared to those of 40 metallic everolimus-eluting stents (EES). Post-procedural device related morphological features were assessed. This included incidences of gross underexpansion and the stent eccentricity index (SEI, minimum/maximum diameter) as a measure for focal radial strength.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients receiving BVS were younger than those with EES (54.0 ± 11.2 years versus 61.7 ± 11.4 years, p = 0.012), the remaining baseline, vessel and lesion characteristics were comparable between groups. Lesion pre-dilatation was more frequently performed and inflation time was longer in the BVS than in the EES group (n = 34 versus n = 23, p = 0.006 and 44.2 ± 12.8 versus 25.6 ± 8.4 seconds, p < 0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences in maximal inflation pressures and post-dilatation frequencies with non-compliant balloons between groups. Whereas gross device underexpansion was not significantly different, SEI was significantly lower in the BVS group (n = 12 (30 %) versus n = 14 (35 %), p = 0.812 and 0.69 ± 0.08 versus 0.76 ± 0.09, p < 0.001, respectively). There was no difference in major adverse cardiac event-rate at six months.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur data show that focal radial expansion was significantly reduced in BVS compared to EES in a clinical routine setting using no routine post-dilatation protocol. Whether these findings have impact on scaffold mid-term results as well as on clinical outcome has to be investigated in larger, randomized trials.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00c1d99ee526e4a73324bea5b39422275e2b2d10","title":"Mechanical properties of the everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold compared to the metallic everolimus-eluting stent","venue":"BMC cardiovascular disorders","year":2016}

It has therefore been suggested that measures derived from software specification representations may provide a consistent basis for relatively accurate estimation of subsequent development attributes. To this end, this paper describes the development of a functional complexity analysis scheme that is applicable to system specification products, rather than to the traditional products of the lower-level design and construction phases. Tate and Verner [1] recently suggested that measures extracted from software specifications may be useful in estimating subsequent development attributes, particularly in an automated development environment. They were able to suggest a number of candidate measures, including the number of data model entities and the number of data flow diagram (DFD) processes. Although certainly useful as a first step, these measures were based only on intuitive expectations. This paper represents a progression from the work of Tate and Verner [1] in that a comprehensive set of operational measures covering several specification dimensions and notations is described. Furthermore, selection of the measures was undertaken with the assistance of structured paradigms as a safeguard to ensure that the chosen measures were relevant to the overall goals of a recent empirical study. The next section of this paper therefore briefly considers the impact that an automated environment has on software assessment, followed by a discussion on the basis of assessment in software specifications. The third section then provides detailed descriptions of the measures chosen for complexity assessment and effort estimation, and of the reasons and assumptions upon which the selection of measures was based. The paper is then concluded with a short summary of the assessment approach and with comments concerning validation. DeMarco [2,3] has suggested that the attributes of an implemented system are directly related to the characteristics of that system's specification. Given the structured and semi-formal nature of several widely used specification models, it has been further suggested that useful and consistent quantitative information relating to system functionality may be derived from these early-phase representations. The utilisation of graphic system models, such as those used in many specification techniques, provides concise yet comprehensive representations of reality; this enables inexpensive analysis of essential system aspects to be performed, without the need to consider excessive low-level details.

Determining the optimal set of software and hardware components to evolve that (1) incorporate cutting-edge technology and (2) satisfy DRE system resource constraints, such as memory, power, and CPU usage is an NP-Hard problem. This article provides four contributions to evolving legacy DRE system configurations. First, we present the Software Evolution Analysis with Resources (SEAR) technique for converting legacy DRE system configurations, external resource availabilities, and candidate replacement components into multiple-choice multi-dimension knapsack problems (MMKP). Second, we present a formal methodology for assessing the validity of evolved system configurations. Third, we apply heuristic approximation algorithms to determine low-cost, high value evolution paths in polynomial time. Finally, we analyze results of experiments that apply these techniques to determine which technique is most effective for given system parameters. Our results show that constraint solvers can only evolve small system configurations, whereas approximation techniques are needed to evolve larger system configurations.","pdfUrls":["http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/Dougherty-CEJS.pdf","http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/Dougherty-CEJS.pdf","http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/sites/default/files/PROOF_CEJCS_dougherty.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s13537-011-0006-0"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00c65086cc23cfc5d6ec687e21f2aa4c1d565e73","title":"Automated software and hardware evolution analysis for distributed real-time and embedded systems","venue":"Central Europ.

When surgeons browse medical images in the operating room, the task is often delegated to an assistant that controls the mouse or keyboard while the surgeon provides instructions. Such interaction, however, is slow, awkward and error-prone. REALISM, (Real-time Hand Gesture Interface for Surgeons and Medical Experts) aims to provide a non-contact human-computer interface through hand gestures. We envision the project with a medical expert in front of a camera performing hand gestures which the computer then interprets as commands for navigation of images and objects. Image navigation is the primary function that the REALISM intends to provide. The implementation of REALISM system is divided into three parts: Hand Detection, Hand Gesture Recognition and Hand Tracking. Gesture vocabulary was designed considering factors such as gestures' ease of use, simplicity and intuitiveness for the users. Gesture vocabulary must also refrain from including poses offensive to certain cultures. The project was developed using OpenCV, a computer vision library originally developed by Intel. Experimental results show that the REALISM system achieved higher precision and recall in well lighted environment than in unlighted environment. The system was able to detect 95.61%-100% of the hands present within the camera's vision in a well lighted environment. While in poorly illuminated environment the system detected 15.98%-96.88% of the hands present within the camera's vision.

This water permeability accounts for up to 50% of ultrafiltration (UF) during a hypertonic dwell, and its loss can be a major clinical problem for PD patients. By analogy with the lung, the hypothesis was tested that corticosteroids may increase AQP1 expression in the peritoneal membrane (PM) and improve water permeability and UF in rats. First, the expression and distribution of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the PM and capillary endothelium was documented. Time-course and dose-response analyses showed that a daily IM injection of dexamethasone (1 or 4 mg/kg) for 5 d induced an approximately twofold increase in the expression of AQP1 at the mRNA and protein levels. The GR antagonist RU-486 completely inhibited the dexamethasone effect. The functional counterpart of the increased AQP1 expression was a significant increase in sodium sieving and net UF across the PM, contrasting with a lack of effect on the osmotic gradient and permeability for small solutes. The latter observation reflected the lack of effect of corticosteroids on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and endothelial NOS isoform expression in the PM. In conclusion, corticosteroids induce AQP1 expression in the capillary endothelium of the PM, which is reflected by increased transcellular water permeability and UF. These data emphasize the critical role of AQP1 during PD and suggest that pharmacologic regulation of AQP1 may provide a target for manipulating water permeability across the PM.","pdfUrls":["http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/14/3/555.full.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00d7151ecac32bd5a6423a6d00ca08dbdcc6242d","title":"Corticosteroids induce expression of aquaporin-1 and increase transcellular water transport in rat peritoneum.","venue":"Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN","year":2003}

These factors, acting in concert, alter soil, water, and air conditions in ways that promote the growth of stress-tolerant, early-successional vegetation on abandoned or unmaintained land. In most urban areas, a cosmopolitan array of spontaneous plants provide important ecological services that, in light of projected climate change impacts, are likely to become more significant in the future. Learning how to manage spontaneous urban vegetation to increase its ecological and social values may be a more sustainable strategy than attempting to restore historical ecosystems that flourished before the city existed. ᮄ Urban ecology can be distinguished from its natural systems counterpart by the inseparable blend of human culture and natural history. Mastering the discipline requires dealing not only with issues related to the quality of air, water, and soil as modified by humans, but also with the complex economic, social, and cultural systems which dictate the flow of energy and raw materials throughout metropolitan areas (Alberti et al. 2003; Gilbert 1989; Grimm et al. 2000). In cities, human values—driven mainly by socioeconomic considerations—typ-ically trump biological factors such that people encourage the presence of organisms that make the environment a more attractive, livable, or profitable place to be, and vilify as weeds and pests those that flourish in contradistinction to these goals. From a strictly functional perspective, most vegetated urban land can be classified into one of three broad categories: remnant native landscapes, managed horticultural landscapes, and abandoned ruderal landscapes","pdfUrls":["http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/Nature-and-Culture-Del-Tredici-2010-winter.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00d8d980e4afdc61e1b0b1aca1dfc4e028664882","title":"Spontaneous Urban Vegetation: Reflections of Change in a Globalized World","venue":"","year":2010}

On the one hand, we describe a functional perspective of preservice mathematics teacher training and learning. This perspective is based on the consideration of didactic notions as instruments to analyze the mathematical subject matter from different viewpoints. On the other hand, we propose some concepts and methods that can allow researchers explore preservice teachers' learning and help trainers assess the impact of methods courses' design and development. Professional approaches to preservice teacher education are concerned with the importance of providing theoretically grounded solutions for professional activities. These approaches highlight the problem of exploring future teachers' learning processes in courses where the students still don't have teaching practice and even the moment of the real practice could be remote for them. Besides, in some cases, as the Spanish one, most of the future secondary mathematics teachers develop in-depth academic mathematical knowledge before starting to think about didactic questions. In this context, the complexity of the processes by which future teachers in university classrooms make links among didactic notions and pupil's mathematical learning at school needs attention. We tackle this problem by adopting a functional view of teacher training. We propose the use of a set of didactic notions, the curriculum organizers (Rico, 1997), structured around the process that an ideal-expert teacher would follow to promote pupils mathematical learning in a constructivist framework, the didactic analysis (Gómez, 2007). This approach attempts to capture the complexity of the mathematics curriculum and serve as theoretical support to structure the variety of meanings of a mathematical notion that have to be negotiated in a mathematics classroom. Future mathematics teachers learning under this approach can be interpreted assuming an instrumented perspective (Vygotsky, 1982). We focus our work in the analysis of how a future teacher learns a curriculum organizer. For this purpose we will describe the epistemic, heuristic and pragmatic functions of a curriculum organizer and we will describe some possible relations among them. We think about mathematics teacher's knowledge from a functional perspective. According to this view, teacher's knowledge can be established from the analysis and description of the activities needed to plan, manage and evaluate a mathematics lesson. Thus, the problem of the teacher's knowledge can be considered as the integration of knowledge, abilities and attitudes for action.

They usually present as acute abdomen and the diagnosis is established intraoperatively. The treatment is surgical and should be performed as soon as possible to decrease the incidence of perioperative mortality and morbidity.\n\n\nCASE PRESENTATION\nWe report an unusual case of a 26-year-old Argentine man with ischemic necrosis in parts of his small and large intestine due to combined ileosigmoid and ileoileal knotting. He had an ileal loop of ileum concurrently wrapped around the neck of a sigmoid volvulus and other loops of ileum strangulating them, forming two different tangles of tying. This very rare and unusual entity was diagnosed and managed intraoperatively during a diagnostic laparotomy performed on an emergency basis. Both the gangrenous small bowel loops and the affected sigmoid colon area were resected. The continuation of the intestinal tract was restored by primary end-to-end anastomoses. The present case is unusual and to the best of our knowledge no similar cases of simultaneous ileosigmoid and ileoileal knotting have been described in the literature. The postoperative course of our patient was uneventful and he was discharged from the hospital on the 15th postoperative day. One year later he still remains without symptoms from his intestinal tract.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSimultaneous ileosigmoid and ileoileal knotting is a very rare entity that should be diagnosed and treated surgically on an emergency basis to minimize the high postoperative morbidity and mortality.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/68/64/1752-1947-8-200.PMC4077116.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00dcc2b7c147f1675c47d05ee02f24fc19e3efa7","title":"An unusual synchronous ileosigmoid and ileoileal knotting: a case report","venue":"Journal of medical case reports","year":2014}

Starting the early 90's [PAH + 94, LLS00, Ter00], collaborations of economists and physicists produced increasingly realistic simulation platforms. Currently, the market stylized facts are easily reproduced and one has now to address the realistic details of the Market Microstructure and of the Traders Behaviour. This calls for new methods and tools capable of bridging smoothly between simulations and experiments in economics. We propose here the following Avatar-Based Method (ABM). The subjects implement and maintain their Avatars (programs encoding their personal decision making procedures) on NatLab, a market simulation platform. Once these procedures are fed in a computer edible format, they can be operationally used as such without the need for belabouring, interpreting or conceptualising them. Thus ABM short-circuits the usual behavioural economics experiments that search for the psychological mechanisms underlying the subjects behaviour. Finally, ABM maintains a level of objectivity close to the classical behaviourism while extending its scope to subjects' decision making mechanisms. We report on experiments where Avatars designed and maintained by humans from different backgrounds (including real traders) compete in a continuous double-auction market. Instead of viewing this as a collectively authored computer simulation , we consider it rather as a new type of computer aided experiment. Indeed we consider the Avatars as a medium on which the subjects can imprint and refine interactively representations of their internal decision making processes. Avatars can be objectively validated (as carriers of a faithful replica of the subject decision making process) by comparing their actions with the ones that the subjects would take in similar situations. We hope this unbiased way of capturing the adaptive evolution of real subjects behaviour may lead to a new kind of behavioural economics experiments with a high degree of reliability, analysability and reproducibility.","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0509017v1.pdf","http://www.savannah-simulations.ch/marketlab/MarketLAB_02.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0509017","http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0509017v1.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00ddd57a836d26bde0a509aaf8e524f279fa2c0e","title":"Traders imprint themselves by adaptively updating their own avatar","venue":"ArXiv","year":2005}

From the educational point of view, the use of mobile devices is leading to an adaptation and modification of teaching and learning processes that require teachers to adjust their methodology to the interests and motivations of the students of the XXI century. Today, any space or environment in which a subject unfolds becomes a ubiquitous and personalized learning space, open to new discoveries and in which learning in both conventional and unconventional contexts thereby multiplies personal, social and professional opportunities in a world in which the changes occur at a high rate. To train competent citizens, able to express themselves in many and varied situations, contexts and realities it is necessary to provide them with rich, exciting and vibrant learning scenarios where the only task is not only to learn but also to develop, acquire and implement new educational opportunities. In this track we intend to reunite all research in the field of educational mobile technologies, which play an important role in the autonomous use that students make of these resources to enhance the skills acquired in the classroom. In this sense, the communications presented, confirm that to an increasingly greater extent, teachers are making a good use of mobile technologies in education thereby reducing the existing gap between the educational sphere and the reality experienced by students in their daily lives.","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3012570"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00df95999b71474e74136317d01c20f80334d09e","title":"A world of digital competences: mobile apps, e-citizenship and computational systems as learning tools","venue":"TEEM","year":2016}

It is of outmost importance to analyze the scalability and limits of such a design workflow. To analyze the design capabilities of libraries of regulatory elements, we have developed the first automated design approach that combines such elements to search the genotype space associated to a given phenotypic behavior. Herein, we calculated the designability of dynamical functions obtained from circuits assembled with a given genetic library. By designing circuits working as amplitude filters, pulse counters and oscillators, we could infer new mechanisms for such behaviors. We also highlighted the hierarchical design and the optimization of the interface between devices. We dissected the functional diversity of a constrained library and we found that even such libraries can provide a rich variety of behaviors. We also found that intrinsic noise slightly reduces the designability of digital circuits, but it increases the designability of oscillators. Finally, we analyzed the robust design as a strategy to counteract the evolvability and noise in gene expression of the engineered circuits within a cellular background, obtaining mechanisms for robustness through non-linear negative feedback loops.","pdfUrls":["http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/20/e138.full-text-lowres.pdf","http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/20/e138.full.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/ac/6c/Nucleic_Acids_Res_2011_Nov_24_39(20)_e138.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00dfb36b3e7c59c712db812826f15358a1b3a670","title":"Computational design of synthetic regulatory networks from a genetic library to characterize the designability of dynamical behaviors","venue":"Nucleic acids research","year":2011}

The video server's hardware limits the maximum storage capacity as well as the maximum number of video sessions that can concurrently be delivered. Clearly, these limits will eventually be exceeded by the growing need for better video quality and larger user population. This paper studies a parallel video server architecture that exploits server parallelism to achieve incremental scalability. First, unlike data partition and replication, the architecture employs data striping at the server level to achieve fine-grain load balancing across multiple servers. Second, a client-pull service model is employed to eliminate the need for interserver synchronization. Third, an admission-scheduling algorithm is proposed to further control the instantaneous load at each server so that linear scalability can be achieved. This paper analyzes the performance of the architecture by deriving bounds for server service delay, client buffer requirement, prefetch delay, and scheduling delay. These performance metrics and design tradeoffs are further evaluated using numerical examples. Our results show that the proposed parallel video server architecture can be linearly scaled up to more concurrent users simply by adding more servers and redistributing the video data among the servers.","pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/71.895790","http://www.mcl.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/papvs_tpds00.pdf","http://www.mclab.info/papvs_tpds00.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00e24bc2f3a253da70cc21fe63cf88e84e90fc9e","title":"Performance Analysis of a Pull-Based Parallel Video Server","venue":"IEEE Trans.

Thus, traditional linear statistical methods fail to model the nonlinearities of such a system. These nonlinea-rities render it necessary to find alternative statistical techniques. Since artificial neural network models (NNM) represent such a nonlinear statistical method their use in analyzing the climate system has been studied for a couple of years now. Most authors use the standard Backpropaga-tion Network (BPN) for their investigations, although this specific model architecture carries a certain risk of over-= underfitting. Here we use the so called Cauchy Machine (CM) with an implemented Fast Simulated Annealing schedule (FSA) (Szu, 1986) for the purpose of attributing and detecting anthropogenic climate change instead. Under certain conditions the CM-FSA guarantees to find the global minimum of a yet undefined cost function (Geman and Geman, 1986). In addition to potential anthropogenic influences on climate (greenhouse gases (GHG), sulphur dioxide (SO 2)) natural influences on near surface air temperature (variations of solar activity, explosive volcanism and the El Ni~ n no=Southern Oscillation phenomenon) serve as model inputs. The simulations are carried out on different spatial scales: global and area weighted averages. In addition, a multiple linear regression analysis serves as a linear reference. It is shown that the adaptive nonlinear CM-FSA algorithm captures the dynamics of the climate system to a great extent. However, free parameters of this specific network architecture have to be optimized subjectively. The quality of the simulations obtained by the CM-FSA algorithm exceeds the results of a multiple linear regression model; the simulation quality on the global scale amounts up to 81% explained variance. Furthermore the combined anthropogenic effect corresponds to the observed increase in temperature Jones et al. (1994), updated by Jones (1999a), for the examined period 1856–1998 on all investigated scales. In accordance to recent findings of physical climate models, the CM-FSA succeeds with the detection of anthropogenic induced climate change on a high significance level. Thus, the CM-FSA algorithm can be regarded as a suitable nonlinear statistical tool for modeling and diagnosing the climate system.","pdfUrls":["http://www.geo.uni-frankfurt.de/iau/klima/PDF_Dateien/Tacwalter_pdf.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00e24c316765a99615c1202b0507b5653e2dbcb7","title":"Nonlinear Statistical Attribution and Detection of Anthropogenic Climate Change Using a Simulated Annealing Algorithm","venue":"","year":2002}

We have demonstrated that by introducing a C(2)H(2) pulse at the beginning of the growth, where methane is still used as the main carbon feeding gas, the growth tendency of CNTs can be changed and the resulting growth morphology will vary from surface growth to forest growth. Similarly, the growth morphology can be changed when the growth temperature is raised. The further characterization via Raman spectroscopy indicates that an increasing C(2)H(2) pulse time will lead to a rise of the D peak for as-grown CNTs, due to the formation of more multi-walled CNTs and the amorphous carbon contamination introduced by extra C(2)H(2), while a high growth temperature tends to produce high-quality CNTs and to reduce the amorphous carbon contamination. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the growth temperature and controlling the C(2)H(2) pulse time, we have managed to produce both suspended CNT bridges and upright forests within a single growth procedure and to form suspended pristine CNT transistors with a relatively high yield. In addition, the electrical properties of these CNT nanostructures have been investigated by electrical transport and scanning photocurrent measurements.","pdfUrls":["http://eecs.vanderbilt.edu/people/yaqiongxu/Papers/2012_NS.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00f02b5f9f681f2eeb55ba12c1c07b90ace7809e","title":"Controlling the growth morphology of carbon nanotubes: from suspended bridges to upright forests.","venue":"Nanoscale","year":2012}

In the ER, CT targets to the ERAD machinery composed of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hrd1-Sel1L complex, in part via the activity of the Sel1L-binding partner ERdj5. This J protein stimulates BiP's ATPase activity, allowing BiP to capture the toxin. Presumably, toxin release from BiP must occur before retrotranslocation. Here, using loss-and gain-of-function approaches coupled with binding studies, we demonstrate that the ER-resident nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) Grp170 and Sil1 induce CT release from BiP in order to promote toxin retrotranslocation. In addition, we find that after NEF-dependent release from BiP, the toxin is transferred to protein disulfide isomerase; this ER redox chaperone is known to unfold CTA1, which allows the toxin to cross the Hrd1-Sel1L complex. Our data thus identify two NEFs that trigger toxin release from BiP to enable successful retrotranslocation and clarify the fate of the toxin after it disengages from BiP.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/11/dc/2181.PMC4462937.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00f2263c591cc35d4679ffb281ac0b1676eeef4b","title":"The nucleotide exchange factors Grp170 and Sil1 induce cholera toxin release from BiP to enable retrotranslocation","venue":"Molecular biology of the cell","year":2015}

Robyn M. Lucas and Anthony J. McMichael review The environment and disease: association or causation? by Sir Austin Bradford Hill on establishing relationships between illness and conditions of work or living. The original paper is reproduced by permission of The Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited Epidemiological studies typically examine associations between an exposure variable and a health outcome. In assessing the causal nature of an observed association, the \" Bradford Hill criteria \" have long provided a background framework — in the words of one of Bradford Hill's closest colleagues, an \" aid to thought \" (1). First published exactly 40 years ago, these criteria also provided biomedical relevance to epidemiological research and quickly became a mainstay of epidemiological textbooks and data interpretation (2). Their checklist nature suited the study of simple, direct causation by disciplines characterized by classic scientific and mathematical training. Most diseases have a multifactorial pathogenesis, but the conceptualization of their causation varies by discipline. While it is scientifically satisfying to elucidate the many component causes of an illness, in public health research the more important emphasis is on the discovery of necessary or sufficient causes that are amenable to intervention. Even so, over the four decades since Bradford Hill's paper appeared, the range of multivariate, multistage and multi-level research questions tackled by epidemiologists has evolved, as have their statistical methods and their engagement in wider-ranging interdisci-plinary research. Within that context it is often not appropriate to seek the discrete cause or causes of a disease, but rather to identify a complex of interrelated and often interacting factors that influence the risk of disease (1). This complicates the assessment of causality. The general context within which Bradford Hill developed his ideas about causal inference warrants brief review here. Most epidemiological research is non-experimental, being conducted in an inherently \" noisy \" environment in free-living populations. For example, the quality of the measurement of exposure and of health status is usually less than in controlled clinical trials or laboratory-based studies (measurement error); there are potential confounding variables that are statistically associated with the exposure variable of interest while also predictive of the health outcome in their own right, and these covariates must be controlled for; the sample of persons …","pdfUrls":["http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/83/10/792.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00f50134e8b67cc17031c2e99bc08ea334a4f733","title":"Association or causation: evaluating links between \"environment and disease\".","venue":"Bulletin of the World Health Organization","year":2005}

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant CIK application in solitary HCC patients undergoing curative resection with stratification of microvascular invasion (MVI).In total, specimens and data from 307 solitary HCC patients undergoing curative resection between January 2007 and December 2010 were included. Of these, 102 patients received CIK treatment after surgery (CIK group), whereas 205 patients did not (control group). Pathological evaluation was used to retrospectively determine MVI status. The CIK group had 60 MVI-negative and 42 MVI-positive patients, while the numbers in control group were 124 and 81. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to validate possible effects of CIK treatment on disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) as appropriate.For all patients, the CIK group exhibited significantly higher OS than the control group (log-rank test; PDFS = 0.055, POS = 0.020). Further analysis based on MVI stratification showed that for patients with MVI, DFS and OS did not differ between the 2 groups (PDFS = 0.439, POS = 0.374). For patients without MVI, the CIK group exhibited better DFS and OS than the control group (PDFS = 0.042, POS = 0.007), and multivariate analyses demonstrated that CIK treatment was an independent prognostic factor both for DFS and OS.For solitary HCC, CIK cell therapy after curative resection improves DFS and OS for patients without MVI, but has no statistically significant survival benefit for patients with MVI.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00fcdf88a075573a891fc75b99498968b2762aed","title":"Adjuvant Cytokine-Induced Killer Cell Therapy Improves Disease-Free and Overall Survival in Solitary and Nonmicrovascular Invasive Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Curative Resection","venue":"Medicine","year":2016}

NCBD:TCA interactions have been implicated in several cancers, however, the mechanisms of NCBD:TCA recognition remain uncharacterized. NCBD:TCA intermolecular recognition has challenged traditional investigation as both NCBD and several of its corresponding TCAs are intrinsically disordered. Using 40μs of explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations, we relate the conformational diversity of ligand-free NCBD to its bound configurations. We introduce two novel techniques to quantify the conformational heterogeneity of ligand-free NCBD, dihedral quasi-anharmonic analysis (dQAA) and hierarchical graph-based diffusive clustering. With this integrated approach we find that three of four ligand-bound states are natively accessible to the ligand-free NCBD simulations with root-mean squared deviation (RMSD) less than 2Å These conformations are accessible via diverse pathways while a rate-limiting barrier must be crossed in order to access the fourth bound state.","pdfUrls":["http://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/proceedings/psb2012/burger.pdf","http://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/proceedings/psb12/burger.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00fd30f6debc91261ec46ef526291b491d7fa15b","title":"Quasi-Anharmonic Analysis Reveals Intermediate States in the Nuclear Co-Activator Receptor Binding Domain Ensemble","venue":"Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing","year":2012}

The aim of the current study was to compare the accuracy of this new index with the Bispectral Index (BIS), predicted effect-site concentration of propofol, and hemodynamic measures.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty female patients scheduled for ambulatory gynecologic surgery received effect compartment controlled infusion of propofol. Target effect-site concentration was started at 1.5 microg/ml and increased every 4 min by 0.5 microg/ml. At every step, sedation level was compared with monitoring values using different clinical scoring systems and reaction to noxious stimulus.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBispectral Index, AAI, and predicted propofol effect-site concentration were accurate indicators for the level of sedation and loss of consciousness. Hemodynamic variables were poor indicators of the hypnotic-anesthetic status of the patient. BIS correlated best with propofol effect-site concentration, followed by AAI. Hemodynamic measurements did not correlate well. No indicators predicted reaction to noxious stimulus. Poststimulus, BIS and AAI showed an increase as a result of arousal. This reaction occurred more rapidly with the AAI than with BIS.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBispectral Index, AAI, and predicted propofol effect-site concentration revealed information on the level of sedation and loss of consciousness but did not predict response to noxious stimulus.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0105d3024a1230a55018a1236ce48c7f7e2eba1e","title":"Performance of the ARX-derived auditory evoked potential index as an indicator of anesthetic depth: a comparison with bispectral index and hemodynamic measures during propofol administration.","venue":"Anesthesiology","year":2002}

In this problem, the input database is assumed to be very large and most of the algorithms are designed to minimize the number of scans of the database. Enumerating association rules is usually an expensive task due to the size of the input database. A proposed approach for reducing the running time of this process is random sampling. Of course, any implementation of an algorithm that uses sampling must solve the problem of determining which sample size is appropriate. Previous research of sampling for association rule mining has approached this problem concluding that, in general, the theoretically obtained sample size bounds are far from what is observed in practice. In this paper, we try to reduce this gap between theory and practice. We propose two on-line sampling algorithms for association rule mining. Our algorithms maintain the same theoretical guarantees of previous approaches while using a much smaller number 1 of transactions in most of the cases. In the experiments we report, this improvement is often by an order of magnitude.","pdfUrls":["http://www.lsi.upc.es/~carlos/AssRulesSam.ps.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0106a362c3e34414066a34cb6dd5dd6db5822871","title":"On-line Sampling Methods for Discovering Association Rules","venue":"","year":1998}

fibres have different properties with respect to force, contraction speed, endurance, oxidative/glycolytic capacity etc. Although adult muscle fibres are normally post-mitotic with little turnover of cells, the physiological properties of the pre-existing fibres can be changed in the adult animal upon changes in usage such as after exercise. The signal to change is mainly conveyed by alterations in the patterns of nerve-evoked electrical activity, and is to a large extent due to switches in the expression of genes. Thus, an excitation-transcription coupling must exist. It is suggested that changes in nerve-evoked muscle activity lead to a variety of activity correlates such as increases in free intracellular Ca(2+) levels caused by influx across the cell membrane and/or release from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum, concentrations of metabolites such as lipids and ADP, hypoxia and mechanical stress. Such correlates are detected by sensors such as protein kinase C (PKC), calmodulin, AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ), and oxygen dependent prolyl hydroxylases that trigger intracellular signaling cascades. These complex cascades involve several transcription factors such as nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), myogenic differentiation factor (myoD), myogenin, PPARδ, and sine oculis homeobox 1/eyes absent 1 (Six1/Eya1). These factors might act indirectly by inducing gene products that act back on the cascade, or as ultimate transcription factors binding to and transactivating/repressing genes for the fast and slow isoforms of various contractile proteins and of metabolic enzymes. The determination of size and force is even more complex as this involves not only intracellular signaling within the muscle fibres, but also muscle stem cells called satellite cells. Intercellular signaling substances such as myostatin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) seem to act in a paracrine fashion. Induction of hypertrophy is accompanied by the satellite cells fusing to myofibres and thereby increasing the capacity for protein synthesis. These extra nuclei seem to remain part of the fibre even during subsequent atrophy as a form of muscle memory facilitating retraining.

One critical component for this integration is responsiveness, the capacity to support on-demand computing and interactivity. Grid scheduling is involved at two levels in order to provide responsiveness: the policy level and the implementation level. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we present a detailed analysis of the performance of the EGEE grid with respect to responsiveness. Second, we examine two user-level schedulers located between the general scheduling layer and the application layer. These are the DIANE (DIstributed ANalysis Environment) framework, a general-purpose overlay system, and a specialized, embedded scheduler for gPTM3D, an interactive medical image analysis application. Finally, we define and demonstrate a virtualization scheme, which achieves guaranteed turnaround time, schedulability analysis, and provides the basis for differentiated services. Both methods target a brokering-based system organized as a federation of batch-scheduled clusters, and an EGEE implementation is described.","pdfUrls":["http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Loomis/publication/225687891_Scheduling_for_Responsive_Grids/links/0deec514ea71898904000000.pdf","http://www.lri.fr/~cecile/publis/GCJv14.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10723-007-9086-4"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/010f3407c141dfafbcddf8db50f4b8914f9a3d0d","title":"Scheduling for Responsive Grids","venue":"J.

The examination of possible correlations between personality traits and the presence of dementia is complicated by some methodical problems concerning the objective, reliable, and valid assessment especially of premorbid personality style of demented persons. There is some evidence that a higher level of education can not be considered as protective factors but seems to delay the progression and modify the clinical manifestation of the disease. How other premorbid personality traits influence the course of the disease is still unresolved. A trend towards an uniform personality alteration in the course of the disease seems to exist.

Within the brain, redox-active metals, such as manganese, play an important role as components of proteins essential for neural function. However, increasing evidence implies its participation in neurodegenerative diseases involving immune modulation. Prostaglandins (PGs) are lipid mediators that participate in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological processes, particularly during brain inflammation. In this study, we investigated whether the immune modulating action of manganese involved regulation of PGE2 production in cortical astrocytes. Within non-toxic concentrations, manganese caused an elevation in the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA and protein and increased PGE2 release. Manganese potentiated COX-2 expression and PGE2 generation by lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma-activated astrocytes. The inductive action of manganese was accompanied by generation of oxidative stress, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), AKT, and protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-alpha), and increased NF-kappaB and AP-1 DNA binding activities. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was critical to manganese-induced changes in astrocytes, including MAPKs, PKC-alpha, NF-kappaB, AP-1, and COX-2 expression but not AKT. Collectively, these data indicate that manganese might cause changes in neural activity through the modulation of oxidative and inflammatory events in astrocytes.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/011037cdc32c6c77efe79355ba8edccd697abba3","title":"Induction of cyclooxygenase-2 expression by manganese in cultured astrocytes.","venue":"Neurochemistry international","year":2007}

Recently proposed three Goertzel kernels offer significant improvement (up to 90 %) in the noise performance of the time-multiplexed architecture to allow word-length specifications get reduced. In this paper, a highly optimized reconfigurable DCT architecture is proposed that can perform the function of three different kemels (Type A, B and C) on Virtex FPGA.","pdfUrls":["http://westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk/965/01/Dempster,_Beck,_Demirsoy_&_Kale_2003_final.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0110754d71086a8b8a5b706f1157188ca0e5b836","title":"Reconfigurable implementation of recursive DCT kernels for reduced quantization noise - Circuits and Systems, 2003.

LAB displays numerous antimicrobial activities. This is mainly due to the production of organic acids, but also of other compounds, such as bacteriocins and antifungal peptides. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides that are active against other bacteria, either of the same species (narrow spectrum), or across genera (broad spectrum). In recent years, bacteriocin producing LAB have attracted significant attention because of their potential use as safe additives for food preservation that could, at least partially, replace chemical preservatives. LAB were isolated using MRS media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS). 28 lactobacilli were isolated from 20 different samples. Among the isolate 4 strains of Lactobacilli were observed to have activity against 3 diferent strains and also against S.aureus, MRSA, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus only 14.2% of the isolated strains were found to be producing bacteriocin like substance and all of them were isolated from the milk samples. Bacteriocin sensitivity to physical conditions and chemical substances were also evaluated. The test bacteriocin was found to be a sensitive to choloroform and resistant to catalase treatment. I. INTRODUCTION Bacteriocins are antimicrobial proteinaceous compounds that are inhibitory toward sensitive strains and are produced by both gram positive and gram negative bacteria (1). Bacteriocins are produced by bacteria and possess antibiotic properties, but bacteriocins are normally not termed antibiotics in order to avoid confusion and concern with therapeutic antibiotics that can potentially illicit allergic reactions in humans (2).They are ribosomally synthesized polypeptide possessing bacteriocidal activity that are rapidly digested by proteases in the human digestive tract and relatively hydrophobic and heat stable (3, 4). The Bacteriocins (as colicins) were originally defined as bacteriocidal proteins characterized by lethal biosynthesis, a very narrow range of activity and adsorption to specific cell envelop receptors (4).","pdfUrls":["http://www.ijsrp.org/research-paper-1212/ijsrp-p1285.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01107cc869723e3a02b3a37616f4860f03a3b7e3","title":"Characterization of Bacteriocin Produced by Lactobacillus SP and Optimization of Cultural Conditions","venue":"","year":2012}

However, information about placebo-controlled clinical trials typically focuses on the new intervention being tested and provides limited and at times misleading information about placebos.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe aimed to create an informative, scientifically accurate, and engaging website that could be used to improve understanding of placebo effects among patients who might be considering taking part in a placebo-controlled clinical trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOur approach drew on evidence-, theory-, and person-based intervention development. We used existing evidence and theory about placebo effects to develop content that was scientifically accurate. We used existing evidence and theory of health behavior to ensure our content would be communicated persuasively, to an audience who might currently be ignorant or misinformed about placebo effects. A qualitative 'think aloud' study was conducted in which 10 participants viewed prototypes of the website and spoke their thoughts out loud in the presence of a researcher.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe website provides information about 10 key topics and uses text, evidence summaries, quizzes, audio clips of patients' stories, and a short film to convey key messages. Comments from participants in the think aloud study highlighted occasional misunderstandings and off-putting/confusing features. These were addressed by modifying elements of content, style, and navigation to improve participants' experiences of using the website.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have developed an evidence-based website that incorporates theory-based techniques to inform members of the public about placebos and placebo effects. Qualitative research ensured our website was engaging and convincing for our target audience who might not perceive a need to learn about placebo effects. Before using the website in clinical trials, it is necessary to test its effects on key outcomes including patients' knowledge and capacity for making informed choices about placebos.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0112bf2fe369776f47c84070474606e0ad103077","title":"Informing Patients About Placebo Effects: Using Evidence, Theory, and Qualitative Methods to Develop a New Website","venue":"JMIR research protocols","year":2016}

Moreover, this effect is stronger for firms operating in capital-intensive industries. We propose a theoretical mechanism that rationalizes these findings. The fragmentation of the value chain weakens the union's bargaining position, by limiting the amount of revenues that are subject to union extraction. The outsourcing strategy reduces the share of surplus that is appropriated by the union, which enhances the firm's incentives to invest. Since investment creates relatively more value in capital-intensive industries, increases in union power are more likely to be conducive to outsourcing in those industries. Overall, our findings suggest that multinational firms use their organizational structure strategically when sourcing intermediate inputs from unionized markets. * We are greatly indebted to Thierry Verdier for invaluable guidance.

Data warehouses are systems with significant complexity in their architecture and operation. Apart from the central data warehouse itself, which typically involves an elaborate hardware architecture, several sources of data, in different operational environments are involved, along with many clients that access the data warehouse in various ways. The infrastructure complexity is only one part of the problem; the largest part of the problem lies in the management of the data that are involved in the warehouse environment. Source data with different formats, structure, and hidden semantics are integrated in a central warehouse and then, these consolidated data are further propagated to different end-users, each with a completely different perception of the terminology and semantics behind the structure and 2 content of the data offered to them. Thus, the administrators, designers and application developers that cooperate towards bringing clean, up-to-date, consolidated and unambiguous data from the sources to the end-users need to have a clear understanding of the following issues (see more in the following section): − the location of the data, − the structure of each involved data source, − the operations that take place towards the propagation, cleaning, transformation and consolidation of the data towards the central warehouse, − any audit information concerning who has been using the warehouse and in what ways, so that its performance can be tuned, − the way the structure (e.g., relational attributes) of each data repository is related to a common model that characterizes each module of information. Data warehouse metadata repositories store large parts (if not all) of this kind of data warehouse metadata and provide a central point …","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.uoi.gr/~pvassil/publications/2009_DB_encyclopedia/DW_metadata.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01157536eaab1dd62ffe065fe7fe7f8750ed6388","title":"Data Warehouse Metadata Historical Background","venue":"","year":2008}

Unlike all-pay auctions where a usual design objective would be to maximize revenue, in crowdsourcing contests, the principal only benefits from the submission with the highest quality. We give a theory for optimal crowdsourcing contests that mirrors the theory of optimal auction design: the optimal crowdsourcing contest is a virtual valuation optimizer (the virtual valuation function depends on the distribution of contestant skills and the number of contestants). We also compare crowdsourcing contests with more conventional means of procurement. In this comparison, crowdsourcing contests are relatively disadvantaged because the effort of losing contestants is wasted. Nonetheless, we show that crowd-sourcing contests are 2-approximations to conventional methods for a large family of \" regular \" distributions, and 3.2-approximations, otherwise.","pdfUrls":["http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?CFID=63838676&CFTOKEN=79617016&id=2095185","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.2893v1.pdf","http://siam.omnibooksonline.com/2012SODA/data/papers/445.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2893","http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~balu2901/papers/2011/opt_cs.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-2864-4_757"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01157c407f776e62c0376a858307344fe9dea110","title":"Optimal Crowdsourcing Contests","venue":"Encyclopedia of Algorithms","year":2012}

The use of race as a signal arises here, as in models of statistical discrimination, from imperfect information about the return to transactions with particular agents. In a search framework, signaling supports not simply a discriminatory equilibrium, but a pattern of racially segregated transactions, which in turn perpetuates the informational asymmetries. Minority groups necessarily suffer disproportionately from segregation, since the degree to which transactions opportunities are curtailed depends upon group size, as well as the informational \" distance \" between racial groups. However, in some variants of the model, minority agents will self-segregate since they face an adverse selection of majority agents who are willing to trade with them. We also show that, if agents are able to learn from transactions, racial signaling can emerge with only minimal assumptions about the ex ante importance of race. Extensive comments from Fahad Khalil and seminar participants at Simon Fraser University are greatly appreciated. We are grateful to the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation for financial support. In any review of the current state of race relations in America, two important economic facts stand out: the continued disparity in income between black and white Americans, and the pervasive racial segregation of neighborhoods, schools, and social networks. After declining in the 1980s, the relative income of African-American households rose in the late 1990s to about 65% of white household income. 1 However, the earnings of black men working full-time have remained at about 70% of the full-time earnings of white men for the past 30 years. Residential segregation in urban America remains extremely high, though levels of segregation decreased slowly and unevenly throughout the past three decades. 2 Black-white segregation in schools, however, appears to have increased. 3 In this paper we explore the relationship between imperfect information, racial disparities, and segregation. We take as a primitive assumption that when an agent thinks about the value of engaging in trade with another person, the agent uses race in forming her conditional probability distribution over outcomes. The unconditional distribution of quality is assumed to be the same for each race, but we assume that agents are better able to separate signal from noise in inferring the value of trade for one group than for the other.

This establishes the equivalence of its channel capacity with the value of a certain dynamic program. 1. Introduction. The problem of characterizing and computing the capacity of a Markov channel, i.e., a channel whose transmission characteristics vary according to a finite state Markov chain, has attracted considerable attention in recent years [8], [10], [13]. In this article, we propose a radically different approach to the problem. This is based on converting it to an equivalent stochastic control problem which allows us to characterize the channel capacity as the value of an associated dynamic program. This is achieved by adapting the techniques of [3] for the present case. In addition to the theoretical interest, this also opens up the possibility of employing numerical techniques of stochastic control for approximate capacity calculations. The paper is organized as follows: The rest of this section sets up the notation and introduces the problem. The next section derives the equivalent stochastic control problem. Section 3 derives the associated dynamic programming equations. Section 4 outlines some extensions and directions for future research. Two technical appendices deal with resp. the lengthy proof of a key lemma (Lemma 3.2) and a scheme for relaxing one of the main modelling restrictions (aperiodicity of the underlying chain). We shall be dealing with the following objects: • An irreducible aperiodic Markov chain {S n } taking values in a finite state space S, indicating the randomly varying channel characteristics. • An input process {X n } taking values in a finite input alphabet X. • An output process {Y n } taking values in a finite output alphabet Y.","pdfUrls":["http://www-sop.inria.fr/mistral/personnel/Arzad-Alam.Kherani/channelcap.ps"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/011895158f6bb561359781c4d3c92193464f0d19","title":"Capacity of Markov Channels: a Stochastic Control Approach","venue":"","year":2008}

Resource-bounded languages provide strong guarantees about the run-time behavior of programs but often lack mechanisms that allow programmers to write more structured, modular, and reusable programs. To overcome this basic tension in language design, this paper advocates taking into account the natural distinction between the development platform and the deployment platform for resource-sensitive software. To illustrate this approach, we develop the meta-theory for GeHB, a two-level language in which first stage computations can involve arbitrary resource consumption, but the second stage can only involve functional programs that do not require new heap allocations. As an example of a such a second-stage language we use the recently proposed first-order functional language LFPL. LFPL can be compiled directly to malloc-free, imperative C code. We show that all generated programs in GeHB can be transformed into well-typed LFPL programs, thus ensuring that the results established for LFPL are directly applicable to GeHB.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.rice.edu/~taha/publications/conference/emsoft03.ps","http://www.cs.rice.edu/~taha/publications/conference/emsoft03.pdf","http://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/hwxi/academic/papers/emsoft03.pdf","http://www.cs.rice.edu/~taha/teaching/05S/511/papers/emsoft03.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-45212-6_22","http://www.cs.bu.edu/faculty/hwxi/academic/papers/emsoft03.pdf","http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/hwxi/academic/papers/emsoft03.pdf","http://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/academic/papers/emsoft03.pdf","http://www.church-project.org/reports/electronic/Taha+Ellner+Xi:EMSOFT-2003.pdf.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0118b6d65ca15dd566035e8bead89d0790002918","title":"Generating Heap-Bounded Programs in a Functional Setting","venue":"EMSOFT","year":2003}

Ubiquitin immunoreactivity was also increased in the ischaemic hemisphere, again only a proportion of neurones were stained. The Alz-50 antibody recognises the microtubule-associated protein tau and stains neurofibrillary tangles as well as neurones vulnerable to neurofibrillary change in tissue sections of Alzheimer brain. The results indicate that there are changes in tau protein in response to an ischaemic insult, but only in some neurones, which may reflect an early stage of the degenerative process.

When the sizes of such segments are less than the desired value for campaign budgets, there is a need to use probabilistic modeling to expand the size. This process is termed look-alike modeling. Given the multitude of data providers and on-line data sources, there are thousands of segments for each targetable consumer extracted from billions of online (even offline) actions performed by millions of users. The majority of advertisers, marketers and publishers have to use large scale distributed infrastructures to create thousands of user segments on a daily basis. Developing accurate data mining models efficiently within such platforms is a challenging task. The volume and variety of data can be a significant bottleneck for non-disk resident algorithms, since operating time for training and scoring hundreds of segments with millions of targetable users is non-trivial.\n In this paper, we present a novel k-means based distributed in-database algorithm for look-alike modeling implemented within the nPario database system. We demonstrate the utility of the algorithm: accurate, invariant of size and skew of the targetable audience(very few positive examples), and dependent linearly on the capacity and number of nodes in the distributed environment. To the best of our knowledge this is the first ever commercially deployed distributed look-alike modeling implementation to solve this problem. We compare the performance of our algorithm with other distributed and non-distributed look-alike modeling techniques, and report the results over a multi-core environment.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/011f766e644d02020e0a798532585eb5a4f1fd17","title":"Audience segment expansion using distributed in-database k-means clustering","venue":"ADKDD '13","year":2013}

Algorithms for replicat-ing distributed services do however face a dilemma: they should be (1) efficient (low latency), while (2) ensuring consistency of the replicas, which are two contradictory goals. The paper concentrates on active replication, where all the replicas handle the clients' requests. Active replication is usually implemented using the Atomic Broadcast primitive. To be efficient, some Atomic Broadcast algorithms deliberately sacrifice consistency, if inconsistency is likely to occur with a low probability. We present in the paper an algorithm that handles replication efficiently in most scenarios, while preventing inconsistencies. The originality of the algorithm is to take the client-server interaction into account, while traditional solutions consider Atomic Broadcast as a black box.","pdfUrls":["http://lsewww.epfl.ch/Documents/postscript/FS01.ps","http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/49984/files/FS00.pdf","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pascal_Felber/publication/3895250_Optimistic_active_replication/links/09e41513edc727760e000000.pdf","http://www.eurecom.fr/~felber/publications/ICDCS-01.ps","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICDSC.2001.918963","http://lsewww.epfl.ch/Documents/acrobat/FS00.pdf","http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/52363/files/IC_TECH_REPORT_200035.pdf","https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/52363/files/IC_TECH_REPORT_200035.pdf","http://members.unine.ch/pascal.felber/publications/ICDCS-01.pdf","http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/49984/files/FS00.pdf?version=1"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0121e77c83593aca90d39b9ad83870187847070e","title":"Optimistic Active Replication","venue":"ICDCS","year":2001}

Indépendamment des stratégies de construction utilisées, inférer automatiquement de nouvelles relations à partir de celles déjà existantes est une approche possible pour améliorer la couverture et la qualité globale de la ressource. Dans ce contexte, le moteur d'inférences a pour but de formuler de nouvelles conclusions (c'est-à-dire des relations entre les termes) à partir de prémisses (des relations préexistantes). L'approche que nous proposons est basée sur une méthode de triangulation impliquant la transitivité sémantique avec un mécanisme de blocage pour éviter de proposer des relations douteuses. Les relations inférées sont proposées aux contributeurs pour être validées. Dans le cas d'invalidation, une stratégie de réconciliation est engagée pour identifier la cause de l'inférence erronée : une exception, une erreur dans les prémisses, ou une confusion d'usage causée par la polysémie. In Computational Linguistics, validated lexical-semantic networks are crucial resources. Regardless the construction strategies used, automatically inferring new relations from already existing ones may improve coverage and global quality of the resource. In this context, an inference engine aims at producing new conclusions (i.e. potential relations) from premises (pre-existing relations). The approach we propose is based on a triangulation method involving the semantic transitivity with a blocking mechanism to avoid proposing dubious relations. Inferred relations are then proposed to contributors to be validated or rejected. In cas of invalidation, a reconciliation strategy is implemented to identify the cause of the erroneous inference : an exception, an error in the premises, or a confusion caused by polysemy.","pdfUrls":["http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~antho/F/F13/F13-1025.pdf","http://anthology.aclweb.org/F/F13/F13-1025.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology/F/F13/F13-1025.pdf","http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/F/F13/F13-1025.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology//F/F13/F13-1025.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0126a8079d4286a11040bae637f84049c663976b","title":"Inférences déductives et réconciliation dans un réseau lexico-sémantique","venue":"","year":2013}

Biological data of the BMC, CSP, and TRJ colonies were similar. The biology ofthe PSP colony was not evaluated. The ITS2 sequence variations observed between the tick colonies ranged from 1.3 to 4.9%, and the similarity tree constructed by the neighbor-joining method with nucleotide distances showerl that the distances between the samples were similar to what is expected for intraspecific variations found in other ticks species.

However, often due to financial or experimental considerations, e.g. lack of sample, there is little or no replication of the experiments or hybridizations. These factors combined with the intrinsic variability associated with the measurement of gene expression can result in an unsatisfactory detection rate of differential gene expression (DGE). Our motivation was to provide an easy to use measure of the success rate of DGE detection that could find routine use in the design of microarray experiments or in post-experiment assessment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this study, we address the problem of both random errors and systematic biases in microarray experimentation. We propose a mathematical model for the measured data in microarray experiments and on the basis of this model present a t-based statistical procedure to determine DGE. We have derived a formula to determine the success rate of DGE detection that takes into account the number of microarrays, the number of genes, the magnitude of DGE, and the variance from biological and technical sources. The formula and look-up tables based on the formula, can be used to assist in the design of microarray experiments.

Using a multivariate discriminant function derived from a previous study of chronic schizophrenics, totally 77 (85.6%) individuals of our patient and control sample could be correctly classified by a set of 12 acoustic variables at entry into study. At hospital release, the majority of patients (64.4%) still exhibited speech impairment although acute psychopathology had significantly improved. A configuration of 6 acoustic variables, assessed at the time point of entry into study, predicted at high reliability the severity of the negative syndrome at hospital release. Acute medication effects did not explain these findings, thus underlining the potential diagnostic relevance of the speech analysis method. With respect to the relationship between speech characteristics and acute psychopathology throughout the time course of recovery, our results suggest that changes in speaking behavior and speech sound characteristics may be distinct aspects of schizophrenia that can persist in a subgroup of patients over a long period, mostly beyond the time point of hospital release. Accordingly, the speech analysis method might become very useful in detailing the nature and severity of deficits in patients after remission of positive symptoms.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/012f12c986ec91a81f343f93c685acf2fe348061","title":"Speaking behavior and speech sound characteristics in acute schizophrenia.","venue":"Journal of psychiatric research","year":1998}

Our main result is the classification of all strongly-modular fusion algebras of dimension two, three and four and the classification of all nondegenerate strongly-modular fusion algebras of dimension less than 24. We use the classification of the irreducible representations of the finite groups SL(2, Z p λ) where p is a prime and λ a positive integer.

We present a model of how MT cells aggregate responses from VI to form such a velocity representation. Two different sets of units, with local receptive fields, receive inputs from motion energy filters. One set of units forms estimates of local motion, while the second set computes the utility of these estimates. Outputs from this second set of units \"gate\" the outputs from the first set through a gain control mechanism. This active process for selecting only a subset of local motion responses to integrate into more global responses distinguishes our model from previous models of velocity estimation. The model yields accurate velocity estimates in synthetic images containing multiple moving targets of varying size, luminance, and spatial frequency profile and deals well with a number of transparency phenomena.","pdfUrls":["http://papers.cnl.salk.edu/PDFs/Filter%20Selection%20Model%20for%20Generating%20Visual%20Motion%20Signals%201993-3146.pdf","http://nips.djvuzone.org/djvu/nips05/0369.djvu","http://papers.nips.cc/paper/679-filter-selection-model-for-generating-visual-motion-signals.pdf","ftp://ftp.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/neuroprose/nowlan.vismotion.ps.Z"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0130ce3b7d46bfe1c6b9183c6ddb0731d3c81fb0","title":"Filter Selection Model for Generating Visual Motion Signals","venue":"NIPS","year":1992}

The capabilities of these devices are very limited when compared to a desktop computers or laptops. Media resources delivered to these devices therefore has to be adapted. MPEG-21 introduces efficient tools to set up such a capability negotiation, where finally an adapted media resource is delivered to the consumer device. The idea is that the media provider knows all the capabilities of the terminal receiving the media resource. This way, no network or terminal resources are wasted, and session failures caused by missing codecs, too large spatial video resolution and other limitations in terminal capabilities are avoided. The tools developed in MPEG-21 are an important contribution to enable UMA (Universal Multimedia Access) in the rapid growing market for online exchange of rich media resources.

Although a considerable number of analyses of the clinical, histopathological and molecular biological details underlying the mechanism responsible for the development of coronary arterial lesions, it is still poorly understood.The purpose of this study was to analyze the state of angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and the distribution of blood vessels using an animal model of KD like vasculitis. We investigated the involvement of the vasa vasorum from the adventitia in the vascular involvement and the development of the disease state by performing sequential histopathology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro computed tomography (CT) studies using a murine model of vasculitis induced by the Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo prepare the animal model of KD like vasculitis, CAWS was intraperitoneally injected into C57BL/6N mice for five consecutive days as reported by Ohno et al. We observed the changes of the vasa vasorum at the aorta and the orifices of the coronary arteries by SEM and micro CT, and also compared the neovascularization at the media and adventitia of the aorta by an immunohistochemical analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs previously reported, obvious inflammation was detected two weeks after the injection of CAWS, and also intimal thickening was observed three weeks after the injection.

We will demonstrate this using a case study based on the interurban road network of Northern Israel. Currently it is standard practice around the world to allocate routine police vehicles based on an analysis of the frequent accidents on the roads, commonly known as 'hazardous locations'. In Israel, a traffic model assigns vehicles based on accident severity and traffic volume. The assumption to date is that the presence of a police vehicle on roads with high traffic volumes, which generally also have large numbers of accidents, will reduce both the number of traffic violations and the number and severity of accidents. The problem with the current analysis is its failure to account for the response time of the same vehicles that are required to deal with additional events to which they are called, such as accidents, obstacles reported on the road, congestion and other events. This research therefore discusses the application of the maximum covering location problem taking into account simultaneously 'hazardous locations', traffic volume and maximum coverage of the relevant sectors. The results of the model will enable improved coverage of the network that maximizes the traffic volume capture hence reducing response time to relevant events and improving police efficiency.","pdfUrls":["http://lipas.uwasa.fi/~phelo/ICIL2008TelAviv/29.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0142f4ce9eccd3a4bf978180cbf9982a5476934b","title":"The Police Vehicle Location-allocation Problem","venue":"","year":2008}

It is usually not elicited when subjects either ignore or fail to detect the stimulus. The presence of P300 is therefore thought to reflect conscious processing of the stimulus. Since P300 has been shown to be an attention-dependent cognitive component in wakefulness, one might suppose that it would be absent during sleep-a time in which information processing of external stimuli is commonly thought to be inhibited. This review examines the presence or absence of P300 in studies employing auditory odd-ball paradigms in sleep. Research to date indicates that P300 can be recorded during the transition to sleep and then reappears in REM sleep. Stimuli that are rare and intrusive are more likely to elicit the classic parietal P300 in REM sleep. There is, however, little or no positivity at frontal sites. This is consistent with brain imaging studies that show frontal deactivation is characteristic of REM sleep. These findings indicate that while sleepers may be able to detect stimulus deviance in stage 1 and REM, the frontal contribution to consciousness may be lost. In non-REM sleep, a later positive wave at 450 ms does not vary according to experimental manipulation in the same way as the waking and REM P300s. This non-REM sleep-related positivity may therefore underlie mechanism distinct from the waking P300.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01499bfd6fcab1a721bdaa84d157cefbd9e25228","title":"Probing awareness during sleep with the auditory odd-ball paradigm.","venue":"International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology","year":2002}

Like its comrade, Alzheimer's disease, ageing is its best friend. Patients and families tell tales of behavioural changes that sometimes encroach on the incredible: \" Mummy threw her faeces at me this morning, doc \". Language can also be lost. 2 Words like \" dog \" , \" eyes \" , and \" thing \" are retained, whereas words like \" equestrian \" , \" aardvark \" , and \" asparagus \" are meaningless. With progression, eventually only the shell of a person lingers on, until death ensues. This disease not only steals individual lives, but also can target families. In some instances, family members can be affl icted with motor neuron disease, which can be even more devastating than frontotemporal dementia. 3 The fi rst genetic mutation causing frontotemporal dementia was reported more than a decade ago. 4 Three major genetic abnormalities are now recognised: mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau and the progranulin genes, and repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene. Mutations in these three genes account for most genetic abnormalities identifi ed in frontotemporal dementia 5 and have diff ering clinical, 6 neuroanatomical, 7 and neuropathological associations. 8 Like all neurodegenerative disease, by the time the patient becomes aff ected, irreversible changes are likely to have already been set in motion. Atrophy can already be detected, predominantly in the frontal and temporal lobes. 9 By then, it is probably too late. Unfortunately, most published studies in frontotemporal dementia investigate patients who are already symptomatic. The missing piece is the presymptomatic stage, when symptoms, and even signs, are essentially invisible. Understanding this presymptomatic stage is crucial if therapeutic measures are to be helpful to patients with the disease. The dilemma is how to identify such patients. One solution is to study aff ected families in which genetic status is known. Such studies provide three classes of participants: those without a mutation; those with a mutation who are symptomatic; and those with a mutation who are presymptomatic. In The Lancet Neurology, Rohrer and colleagues 10 capitalise on the value of familial studies to peek under the cloak of invisibility of the presymptomatic stage of frontotemporal dementia.

Many aspects of these studies have been questioned. Here we focus on the selection of a database, methods used in the extraction of this ratio, and interpretation(s) of the results. Soon after the Baryons '92 conference, the VPI group wrote a short note [1] claiming a value of −1.5 ± 0.5% for the E2/M1 ratio-a value in good agreement with the results of an independent analysis from the RPI group [2]. Also in this paper was a value for the E2/M1 ratio obtained in a 'forced fit' to preliminary Σ data from the LEGS group. This forced fit yielded a ratio of −2.9%, a value consistent with the most recent joint analysis of LEGS photoproduction and Compton scattering data (−2.85 ± 0.34 ± 0.21%) [3]. Through the 90's, the database for pion photoproduction benefited from experimental programs at Bonn, BNL, Mainz, SAL and Yerevan. Inverse reaction data were also measured at LANL and TRIUMF. Recent analyses from the Mainz, LEGS, and RPI groups imply that a much larger (larger than −1.5%) E2/M1 ratio is required to fit these more recent measurements. The Mainz group(s) find values of about −2.5% [4,5] while the LEGS [3] and RPI [6] groups have found values closer to (and slightly above) −3%. In order to understand this data dependence, several groups (LEGS, Mainz, RPI, and VPI) have made fits using various subsets of the existing database. The results have been very interesting. The Mainz and LEGS groups have shown that an E2/M1 ratio close to the VPI value can be obtained, within their fitting schemes, if particular sets of data are used. The VPI and RPI groups have also (jointly) found that very similar E2/M1 ratios result when identical databases are fitted. This implies that much of the disagreement between previous analyses has been database dependent and not model dependent. However, one significant problem remains to be resolved. The effect of different cross section measurements, from Bonn, Mainz and BNL, is significant for both the E2/M1 ratio and the M1 amplitude itself. In particular, the LEGS cross sections [7] are considerably larger than the Bonn and Mainz values. Hopefully the reason for this difference can be understood in the near future.","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/nucl-th/9810013v1.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/014bab44454c39ab4e120f791b3516fcada9138a","title":"The E2/m1 Ratio, a Status Report","venue":"","year":2008}

After SCI, RGM+ cells accumulated in lesions and peri-lesional areas. During the first days after SCI, RGM expression was confined to neurons, ballooned neurite fibers/retraction bulbs, smooth muscle/endothelial cells, and to leucocytes infiltrating the lesion. Lesional RGM expression was frequently confined to hypertrophic beta-APP+ and RhoA+ neurites/retraction bulbs. With maturation of the lesion, we observed RGM expression by components of the developing scar tissue (cicatrix), such as fibroblastoid cells, reactive astrocytes and in addition a pronounced extracellular RGM deposition resembling neo-laminae. Frequent RGM+, RhoA+ coexpression by lesional retraction bulbs represent first preliminary evidence of RGM to exert growth inhibitory effects by the second messenger system RhoA.

Seeds enhance plant fitness by allowing plants to withhold their growth until the appearance of appropriate environmental conditions. Thereupon, seeds germinate, allowing the resumption of the plant's life cycle. However, protection and propagation is not expected per se to confer fitness without germination control mechanisms avoiding potentially fatal starts such as germination in an inappropriate season or in the face of sudden environmental changes in light or water quality. It is therefore not surprising that multiple levels of germination control mechanisms have appeared during plant evolution. The first level, present in most plant species, including in the model plant Arabidopsis, is that of seed dormancy where the germination of newly produced seeds is blocked even under favorable germination conditions (i.e., presence of adequate water and light). Seeds must therefore first lose their dormancy in order to germinate. Dormancy is progressively lost over time (after-ripening) or following a cold treatment under wet conditions (stratifica-tion). Once seeds become post-dormant (i.e., able to germinate when exposed to adequate germination conditions), a second level of germination control unfolds, where the pace of germination is adjusted in response to the specific physical parameters of the seed's environment. In Arabidopsis, as in many plant species , the seed coat is essential to prevent dormant seed germination, since its removal triggers embryonic growth. 1 The Arabidopsis seed coat consists of an outer layer of dead tissue, the testa, and a single cell layer of living endosperm tissue surrounding the embryo (Fig. 1). To study the germination-repressive activity of the seed coat, we developed a seed coat bedding assay (SCBA), where the growth of dissected embryos laid on a bed of dissected seed coats is monitored, allowing combinatorial use of seed coat and embryo material of different genetic or ecotype origins. 2 The SCBA therefore allows dissecting genetically in vitro the signaling pathways underlying the seed coat's germination repressive activities. We could show that, upon dormant seed imbibition, the endosperm continuously synthesizes and releases abscisic acid (ABA), a growth-repressing hormone, towards the embryo, thus blocking germination. Thus, the first level of germination control appears to be extra-embryonic and \" delocalized \" to the endosperm. We recently explored whether the endosperm is also involved to control seed germination in non-dormant seeds by considering how Arabidopsis seeds respond to the shade of neighboring plants. 3 Plants detect …","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/1b/f5/cc-11-4489.PMC3562285.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/015107520c2a4860d56dd573dfae0c2775b51513","title":"Control of seed germination in the shade","venue":"Cell cycle","year":2012}

A general model is introduced which is capable of making accurate, quantitative predictions about the phase noise of different types of electrical oscillators by acknowledging the true periodically time-varying nature of all oscillators. This new approach also elucidates several previously unknown design criteria for reducing close-in phase noise by identifying the mechanisms by which intrinsic device noise and external noise sources contribute to the total phase noise. In particular, it explains the details of how 1=f noise in a device upconverts into close-in phase noise and identifies methods to suppress this upconversion. The theory also naturally accommodates cyclostationary noise sources, leading to additional important design insights. The model reduces to previously available phase noise models as special cases. Excellent agreement among theory, simulations, and measurements is observed.","pdfUrls":["http://www-smirc.stanford.edu/papers/JSSC98FEB-ali.pdf","http://smirc.stanford.edu/papers/JSSC98FEB-ali.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01510b3467ddabc6aab696e1fe875a94f78aab02","title":"A General Theory of Phase Noise in Electrical Oscillators","venue":"","year":1998}

The efficacy and responsible handling of such fluids has not been analyzed among Indian dentists and this study aims to address this lacunae.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nClosed ended questionnaire was distributed through email to Indian dentists in July 2012. After inclusion/exclusion criteria, 1484 practitioners constituted the study group with a response rate of 52%.\n\n\nSTATISTICS\nSPSS(®) Version 17.0 (SPSS-IBM Inc., IL, USA) was used to carry out statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were presented. Chi square test was used to identify the association between the parameters; P ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMales (80.8%), undergraduates (78%), exclusive practitioners (81.2%), urban practitioners (68.5%) were the predominant respondents. Predominant of the respondents (97%) used local anesthetic (LA) from bottles. Eight percent have encountered instances of injecting formalin instead of LA in their settings. Safe disposal rules and regulations (P ≤ 0.05), opinion on injecting the other fluids instead of LA as a severe negligent act (P ≤ 0.05) were statistically significant between age groups.

As an abstraction of this problem, we consider a system where energy arrives at the encoder in multiples of a fixed quantity, and the physical layer is modeled accordingly as a finite discrete alphabet channel based on this fixed quantity. Further, for tractability, we consider the case of binary energy arrivals into a unit-capacity battery over a noiseless binary channel. Viewing the available energy as state, this is a state-dependent channel with causal state information available only at the transmitter. Further, the state is correlated over time and the channel inputs modify the future states. We show that this channel is equivalent to an additive geometric-noise timing channel with causal information of the noise available at the transmitter. We provide a single-letter capacity expression involving an auxiliary random variable, and evaluate this expression with certain auxiliary random variable selection, which resembles noise concentration and lattice-type coding in the timing channel. We evaluate the achievable rates by the proposed auxiliary selection and extend our results to noiseless ternary channels.","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.3595v2.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620495","http://www.ece.umd.edu/~ulukus/papers/conf/isit13-ener-harv-finite.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3595","http://wcan.ee.psu.edu/papers/KT_ISIT_2013.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0158302507d7da8581c4780710d7f6bbb6632f45","title":"Binary Energy Harvesting Channel with Finite Energy Storage","venue":"ISIT","year":2013}

The advice in Leviticus 14:33–48 for treating mold infested houses has contemporary meaning in the recent World Health Organization (WHO) document on damp and moldy indoor spaces [1]. In the developed world, faulty combustion, carbon monoxide from coal gas, lead paint, poor ventilation of tenement housing and hospitals have been recognized for decades as unhealthy. Indoor air quality, however, was not appreciated as an important component of public health until the proliferation of sealed buildings, energy conservation programs (urea formaldehyde foam insulation), new products, and the recognition of the health effects of radon, asbestos and latex. Clinical and epidemiologic studies in the late 1980s through the 1990s documented the increase in allergies and asthma in developed countries. Reports out of India, Nepal, and Kenya on the respiratory effects on children and women from cooking and heating with wood, charcoal and dried animal dung began to receive world attention. The 2002 WHO Global Burden of Disease analysis conservatively attributed 2–3% of the world's DALY (Disability Adjusted Life-Year) losses to biomass and solid fuels used in the developing countries [2]. The risks from these fuels, as highlighted in the WHO report, continue to constitute the most significant threats to health from indoor pollutants. The evidence against exposures to secondhand smoke (SHS) has also accumulated. The first significant document on secondhand smoke was the US Surgeon General's 1986 report, which 20 years later was updated and re-published [3]. This updated 2006 report unequivocally stated that there are \" no safe levels for secondhand smoke exposures \".

The goal of the taxonomy is to be able to analyse the mechanisms behind human errors and their recovery. Currently an abundance of taxonomies exist to describe the mechanisms behind human errors whereas very little is known about the mechanisms underlying error detection and recovery. This is unfortunate since timely and effective interventions can often prohibit errors from having serious consequences on system safety. The goal of the present Ph.D. project is therefore to gain more knowledge about how errors are captured. One of the desired outcomes of this project is to provide a basis for reinforcing incident prevention strategies. To do so, it is important to have a structured classification scheme (a taxonomy) in which operational data about the production, detection and recovery of human errors can be categorised including the underlying circumstances behind these human errors and their capture.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/015f8f1772b9b6bb6014995f5521d97d0c6681fb","title":"Development and Validation of a Human Error Management Taxonomy in Air Traffic Control","venue":"","year":2002}

The spatial frequency of the stimulus was changed from 0.25 to 8 cycles/degree. The luminance of the light bars was 10 cd/m(2), and the contrast was 95%. The stimulus was flashed on and off with an on duration of 100 ms and an off duration of 150 ms (4 Hz). The stimulus was centered on the fovea and subtended 12.7 degrees at the cornea. The luminance of the steady light-adapting background was 3.5 cd/m(2). The location of the stimulus on the retina was monitored throughout the recordings. The effects of the spatial frequency of the stimulus on the amplitudes and implicit times of the a-waves, b-waves, and oscillatory potentials (OPs) were determined. fmacERGs were also recorded following intravitreal tetrodotoxin (TTX).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe amplitudes of the a- and b-waves did not change with changes in the spatial frequency of the stimulus. The OPs, on the other hand, responded best to the lowest spatial frequency, and the OPs after the first two were attenuated at intermediate and higher frequencies (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: P < 0.05). TTX reduced all OP wavelets in monkeys.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe OPs of the photopic macular ERGs are affected by the spatial frequency of the stimulus and are reduced by TTX, consistent with their being generated by inner retinal neurons.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/016528d18994d21fa64966f18735ab9dbc8b55ed","title":"Effect of spatial frequency of stimulus on focal macular ERGs in monkeys : fmacERG dependence on the spatial-frequency.","venue":"Documenta ophthalmologica.

This is first a mechanically switched reactor, which is series connected to a thyristor-controlled series compensator in order to enhance the inductive working range. Nevertheless, the switching frequency of VCBs is limited by their mechanical properties. In order to achieve a higher switching frequency, more VCBs are switched in parallel to each other. Second. A device is investigated, which consists of mechanically switched capacitors and a mechanically switched reactor. It is connected to a node in the HV system in order to enhance the voltage quality and to avoid a voltage collapse. Since VCBs are mainly available in the medium-voltage range, a transformer is used to connect the mechanically switched device to the HV system. In this paper, it could be shown that the mechanically switched series reactor is able to enhance the damping progress of power oscillations and that the mechanically switched device using VCBs can stabilize the voltage of the node in case of disturbances, such as faults in the power system. Furthermore, the electrical stress on the VCBs has been assessed for different simulation cases with PSCAD.","pdfUrls":["http://www.ijera.com/papers/Vol2_issue4/M24098107.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/016b3c8fdb3a60c6224523a425dbeb366887f4eb","title":"Vacuum Circuit Breakers in FACTS","venue":"","year":2012}

But how are they designed? What is already known in this emerging field? What are the key questions for future research? These were the questions with which we began our CHI 99 workshop on \"Research Issues in the Design of Online Communities.\" Research in this field is interdisciplinary, and we were fortunate to draw workshop participants from the fields of business , education, sociology, and rhetoric as well as from HCI. The two days were focused on four themes: • Business and Professional Applications • Educational Applications • Identity, Avatars, and Embodiment • Sociology After brief introductions from each research team, Sara Kiesler got us started by leading a provocative discussion of research methodology. We debated both what questions about online communities are interesting, and what questions are possible to ask given available research methodol-ogies. Some participants prefer to use an experimental methodology grounded in experimental psychology and explore only those questions for which \"rigorous\" quantitative answers are possible. Others prefer a design-oriented approach, which relies primarily on qualitative methods from anthropology such as ethnography. Most attendees felt that a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches is warranted, and the challenge is how to use these approaches in a complementary fashion. Next, Wendy Kellogg and Tom Erickson tackled issues of the use of online communities for business. They began by leading the group in a 1950's vintage IBM 'spirit' song, reminding us that the concept of community in business and professional settings is not a new one: many businesses have long found utility in invoking \"community\" to increase affiliation , team work, and mutual support. So, while the idea of virtual communities of business or professional colleagues may be relatively new, the impulses driving the ideas are not. Discussion centered around three issues: the ways in which business/professional communities differ from social and/or educational communities; trust in business/professional settings ; and alternative metaphors for thinking about online communities. Online communities in business settings often differ from other communities in that communication is embedded in a work context where individual and organizational agendas, politics, risks and payoffs can have substantial consequences for participants' jobs and lives. Being a member of such a community is often a long-term commitment , and, because of the frequent opportunities for face to face contact in the course of professional life, it …","pdfUrls":["http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Erickson/publication/242787924_Research_issues_in_the_design_of_online_communities_report_on_the_CHI_99_workshop/links/53d79dd40cf29265323cd75f.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/016c857b5da7806db7c09695eddce786e560d9ec","title":"Research Issues in the Design of Online Communities: Report on the Chi 99 Workshop","venue":"","year":1999}

We analyze the numerical behavior of these limiters applied to a pair of model problems, comparing the error of the approximate solutions, and discuss each limiter's advantages and disadvantages. We then introduce a series of coupled p-enrichment schemes that may be used as standalone dynamic p-enrichment strategies, or may be augmented via any in the family of variable-in-p slope limiters presented. Generally when solving advection-diffusion equations – which are not strictly diffusion dominated – by way of, for example , finite element or finite volume techniques, one observes the presence of spurious oscillations in the solution space often brought about by the existence of shocks in the space of approximate solutions as well as from the presence of sharp and/or discontinuous profiles in the physical domain itself. Such ill-behaved approximate solutions have led to the development of numerous methods designed with the intent to consistently stabilize and ''limit'' the solution in order to deal with these oscillations, as they are seen to arise quite frequently in common scientific applications. For example, slope limiters are known to be of central importance in storm surge modeling [8,32] in order to obtain, for example, well-behaved solutions in the presence of complicated free–boundary conditions along adapting shorelines. Limiting regimes are also of substantial importance in quantum hydrodynamic systems [29,4] and surface wave models [26] where they are used to reduce the oscillations caused by mathematical dispersion terms (i.e. nonlinear third order spatial derivative terms) that pervade, for 0021-9991/$-see front matter Published by Elsevier Inc.","pdfUrls":["http://coast.nd.edu/reports_papers/2011-JCP-mmdwkw-dgslopelimiters.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2011.07.009","http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~michoski/front/Michoski_files/vs.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0173fd9ea1f56057ce3ad1c8a23a8d99c375177c","title":"Adaptive hierarchic transformations for dynamically p-enriched slope-limiting over discontinuous Galerkin systems of generalized equations","venue":"J.

Whether on Saturday or Sunday, in the heat of August or chill of early January, class preparation plays a major role in developing the best possible learning environment for students. Access to current resources is paramount. For HCI educators , the World Wide Web is becoming an essential link to such information. As a frequent searcher for HCI resources, I am amazed at the amount of information already available on the Web. What was once a small set offtp locations in 1993 has blossomed into scores of Web sites in 1996. While the number of sites is increasing, HCI educators still must find ways of applying and integrating these resources into an organized framework (Gasen, 1995). Additionally, ancillary teaching resources are still somewhat lacking both on the Web and in print. These materials represent the \"hows\" of teaching for an HCI educator., e.g. relevant videos and software, suggestions for projects and exercises, additional reading material, overhead transparencies, material and criteria for evaluating student progress, etc. Case studies, or concrete illustrations, of how others integrate the wide variety of materials into HCI courses can be excellent resources. One of the earliest electronic examples was Gary Perlman's SEI Module on User Interface Developmentmotion on both what to teach and how to teach it. Clayton Lewis and John Rieman's (1993) HCI book, \"Task Centered User Interface Design\" also provided ftp access to an online resource for HCI educators (available via the Web at teaching resources, including bibliographies and course syllabi descriptions have been made available through reports such as the ACM SIGCHI Curriculum Report (Hewett et al., 1992, Most recently, Saul Greenberg has provided an outstanding resource for HCI educators-a complete Web site description of CPSC 481: Foundations and Principles of Human Computer Interaction. What makes this site particularly helpful to HCI educators is the inclusion of teaching preparation and resource materials. For example, the site includes descriptions of each topic with associated readings, relevant videos, teacher preparation resources, details on assignments, handouts, overheads etc. The article that follows provides an overview of the course and the rationale for its development. The HCI community must continue to take mmauve m building an accessible and organized web of electronic resources for research and education.

component analysis is a fundamental operation in computational data analysis, with myriad applications ranging from web search to bioinformatics to computer vision and image analysis. However, its performance and applicability in real scenarios are limited by a lack of robustness to outlying or corrupted observations. This paper considers the idealized \" robust principal component analysis \" problem of recovering a low rank matrix A from corrupted observations D = A + E. Here, the error entries E can be arbitrarily large (modeling grossly corrupted observations common in visual and bioinformatic data), but are assumed to be sparse. We prove that most matrices A can be efficiently and exactly recovered from most error sign-and-support patterns, by solving a simple convex program. Our result holds even when the rank of A grows nearly proportionally (up to a logarithmic factor) to the dimensionality of the observation space and the number of errors E grows in proportion to the total number of entries in the matrix. A by-product of our analysis is the first proportional growth results for the related but somewhat easier problem of completing a low-rank matrix from a small fraction of its entries. We propose an algorithm based on iterative thresholding that, for large matrices, is significantly faster and more scalable than general-purpose solvers. We give simulations and real-data examples corroborating the theoretical results.","pdfUrls":["http://dsp.rice.edu/sites/dsp.rice.edu/files/cs/robust_pca.pdf","http://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips22/NIPS2009_0116_correction.pdf","http://yima.csl.illinois.edu/psfile/robust_pca_jacm-submitted.pdf","http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3704-robust-principal-component-analysis-exact-recovery-of-corrupted-low-rank-matrices-via-convex-optimization","http://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.0233v1.pdf","http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3704-robust-principal-component-analysis-exact-recovery-of-corrupted-low-rank-matrices-via-convex-optimization.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/017438e9f62834694a4ea85f87f48bfcbd0490d7","title":"Robust Principal Component Analysis: Exact Recovery of Corrupted Low-Rank Matrices via Convex Optimization","venue":"NIPS","year":2009}

We also Abstract A principal (dean) has an object (job slot) to allocate to one of I agents (departments). Each agent has a strictly positive value for receiving the object. Each agent also has private information which determines the value to the principal of giving the object to him. There are no monetary transfers but the principal can check the value associated with any individual at a cost which may vary across individuals. We characterize the class of optimal Bayesian mechanisms, that is, mechanisms which maximize the expected value to the principal from his assignment of the good minus the costs of checking values. One particularly simple mechanism in this class, which we call the favored–agent mechanism, specifies a threshold value v * and a favored agent i *. If all agents other than i * report values below v * , then i * receives the good and no one is checked. Otherwise, whoever reports the highest value is checked with probability 1 and receives the good iff her report is confirmed. We show that all optimal mechanisms are essentially randomizations over optimal favored–agent mechanisms.","pdfUrls":["http://www.econ.yale.edu/seminars/microt/mt12/benporath-12-10-03.pdf","http://people.bu.edu/blipman/Papers/allocation-post.pdf","http://econ.as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/23819/Dekel_04252012.pdf","http://people.bu.edu/blipman/Papers/allocation%20post%202014-03.pdf","http://people.bu.edu/blipman/Papers/mech-current.pdf","http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/math/seminars/201213/Dekel_11_15_12.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/017f000891361a137e53d90f4365341dc5b5dbc2","title":"Optimal Allocation with Costly Verification","venue":"","year":2012}

However, it is not clear which aspects of POGIL are the most important in terms of actual learning. We compared 354 first-year undergraduate psychology students' learning in physiological psychology using four teaching methods: control, POGIL, POGIL without reporting [no report out (NRO)], and POGIL run by untrained graduate students [new facilitator (NF)]. Student activities were identical across POGIL variations and highly similar for control. Participants' knowledge was evaluated before (pretest), immediately after (posttest), and 2 wk later (followup). Control and POGIL groups showed no improvement at posttest, whereas NRO and NF groups both recalled more material than at pretest (P = 0.002 and P < 0.0005, respectively). In a surprise test 2 wk later, control (P < 0.0005), NRO (P = 0.03), and NF (P < 0.0005) groups recalled less than at posttest. The POGIL group showed the smallest drop in knowledge (P = 0.05). Importantly, the control group's knowledge was below pretest levels (P < 0.0005), whereas the POGIL, NRO, and NF groups' knowledge was not. Self-assessment of knowledge was consistent across groups at pretest, but POGIL participants had the lowest confidence at posttest and 2 wk later. At followup, the control, NRO, and NF groups showed greater confidence in their knowledge than the POGIL group (P = 0.03, P = 0.002, and P = 0.004, respectively). POGIL and its variations appear to consolidate existing knowledge against memory decay even when student confidence does not match performance.","pdfUrls":["http://advan.physiology.org/content/ajpadvan/37/3/233.full.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/018009b4ad38156cfcea83930891234cddf8fe63","title":"Process-oriented guided-inquiry learning improves long-term retention of information.","venue":"Advances in physiology education","year":2013}

Theoretically, in-group categories could facilitate heuristic-based message processing (because of the attractiveness of in-groups and their social reality cues) or systematic-based processing (because of high personal relevance of the message). The authors expected individual differences in uncertainty orientation and socially based expectancy congruence to be important variables in understanding these processes. Participants were exposed to strong or weak, in-group or out-group messages that were either expectancy congruent (in-group agreement, out-group disagreement) or expectancy incongruent (in-group disagreement, out-group agreement). As predicted, uncertainty-oriented participants increased systematic information processing under incongruent conditions relative to congruent (i.e., relatively certain) conditions; certainty-oriented individuals processed systematically only under congruent conditions. These findings suggest that uncertainty that has been created through social-categorization conflicts is treated differently by people of different personality styles.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/018054a4dd29a48e1333365098c859b671558b64","title":"Uncertainty orientation in the group context: categorization effects on persuasive message processing.","venue":"The Journal of social psychology","year":2003}

Here, we compared the viscoelastic properties of Müller cells from man and monkey as well as from different postnatal developmental stages of the rat. We determined the complex Young's modulus E = E' + iE″ in a defined range of deforming frequencies (30, 100, and 200 Hz) using a scanning force microscope, where the real part E' reflects the elastic property (energy storage or elastic stiffness) and the imaginary part E″ reflects the viscous property (energy dissipation) of the cells. The viscoelastic properties were similar in Müller cells from man, monkey, and rat. In general, the elastic behavior dominated over the viscous behavior (E' > E″). The inner process of the Müller cell was the softest region, the soma the stiffest (Einnerprocess(')<Eendfoot(')<Esoma(')). Neuronal somata were stiffer than somata of glial cells (Eneuron(')>Eglia(')). These relations were also observed during the postnatal development of the rat. It is concluded that, generally, retinal cells display mechanics of elastic solids. In addition, the data indicate that the rodent retina is a reliable model to investigate retinal mechanics and tissue alterations after retinal surgery. During retinal development, neuronal branching and synaptogenesis might be particularly stimulated by the viscoelastic properties of Müller cell processes in the inner plexiform layer.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/018558de621f1b693ea366e49d2d6d8ebcf87455","title":"Biomechanical properties of retinal glial cells: comparative and developmental data.","venue":"Experimental eye research","year":2013}

However, this criterion is not sufficient in a real-world scenario. In fact, test-cases generated to cover meta-model elements cannot detect some transformation errors due to model-scalability reasons. These generated test cases are simple and different, in general, from source models that are used in an industrial setting. To make the situation worse, source models cannot be provided by industrial companies due to security/confidentiality reasons. Instead of real data (source models), corporations can provide structural information about their source models (e.g. number of classes, number of relationships, etc.). We propose a search-based approach for generating test cases based on the coverage of structural information in addition to meta-models coverage. The validation results on a transformation mechanism used by an industrial partner confirm the effectiveness of our approach.","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1104/5.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0186d712e6a4b8854e0232eeae47ef6999ffae1a","title":"Test Cases Generation for Model Transformations from Structural Information","venue":"MDEBE@MoDELS","year":2013}

Segmentation based on the threshold surface. However, incomplete cells are still not detected reliably with this method. Double counting is sometimes occurred. In this paper, a Fuzzy Edge Detection Method is proposed. It is based on the Generalized Fuzzy Operator (GFO) [6]. It enhances those cells whose gray-level is of the cells. Morphometric assessment of tumor cells is important in the prediction of biological behavior of thyroid cancer. In order to automate the process, the computer-based system has to recognize the boundary of the cells. Many methods for the boundary detection have appeared in the literature and some of them applied to microscopic slice analysis. However, there is no reliable method since the gray-levels in the nuclei are uneven and are similar to the background. based on an improved Generalized Fuzzy Operator. The In this paper, a Fuzzy Edge Detection Method is used and is to the background and produces boundary method enhances the nuclei and effectively separates the cells from the background.","pdfUrls":["http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/46262/1/60699.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/018ab4e66115350dee83b196d6caeae2209b509c","title":"Title Thyroid Cancer Cells Boundary Location by a Fuzzy Edge Detection Method Thyroid Cancer Cells Boundary Location by a Fuzzy Edge Detection Method","venue":"","year":2004}

We thus investigated the effects of second-generation antipsychotics on white matter integrity using tract-based spatial statistics in patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis with little or no prior antipsychotic exposure, and how potential changes were associated with metabolic side effects. Thirty-five (26 men/9 women) patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis received diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) exams, clinical assessments, and provided fasting blood samples at the onset of antipsychotic treatment, and then again after 12 weeks of treatment with either risperidone or aripiprazole in a double-blind randomized clinical trial. In addition, 35 (26 men/9 women) healthy volunteers received DTI exams at a baseline time point and then after 12 weeks. Patients demonstrated significant (p<0.05; family-wise error corrected) fractional anisotropy reductions within the parietal and occipital white matter following antipsychotic treatment. Greater overall fractional anisotropy reduction was significantly correlated with greater increases in low-density lipoprotein. There were no significant fractional anisotropy increases among patients following treatment. Moreover, healthy volunteers did not demonstrate either significant increases or decreases in fractional anisotropy across a comparable 12-week interval. The use of antipsychotics may be associated with a subtle loss of white matter integrity that is related to greater side effects, thus raising potentially important considerations regarding risk/benefit in their usage. Limitations of the current study, however, include a prior history of substance use among patients and our inability to exclude the possibility of disease progression.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/018bdab1038581829a444b2b2dc5cd12df2f66d3","title":"White matter changes associated with antipsychotic treatment in first-episode psychosis.","venue":"Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","year":2014}

Gene expression is a critical node at which regulatory control of molecular networks is implemented. As such, elucidating the various mechanisms employed in the physiological regulation of gene expression in the CNS is important both for establishing a reference for comparison to the diseased state and for expanding the set of validated drug targets available for disease intervention. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small RNA that mediates potent inhibitory effects on global gene expression. Recent advances have been made in methods employed to study the contribution of these miRNAs to gene expression. Here we review these latest advances and present a methodological workflow from the perspective of an investigator studying the physiological regulation of a gene of interest. We discuss methods for identifying putative miRNA target sites in a transcript of interest, strategies for validating predicted target sites, assays for detecting miRNA expression, and approaches for disrupting endogenous miRNA function. We consider both advantages and limitations, highlighting certain caveats that inform the suitability of a given method for a specific application. Through careful implementation of the appropriate methodologies discussed herein, we are optimistic that important discoveries related to miRNA participation in CNS physiology and dysfunction are on the horizon.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/018f1aa14d87e31b9b54431b3a06ff20594dc762","title":"Advances in microRNA experimental approaches to study physiological regulation of gene products implicated in CNS disorders.","venue":"Experimental neurology","year":2012}

Due to its low solubility in water, the consumption of oxygen leads to the development of oxic-anoxic interfaces, which separate aerobic from anaerobic processes in virtually all environments, ranging in scale from oceanic sediments to the fecal pellets of a small soil invertebrate. Three case studies were selected to illustrate the basic situation and the specific characteristics of oxic-anoxic interfaces: sediments, the rhizosphere of aquatic plants, and the intestinal tract of insects. Each system is governed by the same general principles, but striking differences arise from, e.g., the nature of the major microbial activities and the mechanisms controlling metabolite fluxes. Also scale and dimensional differences as well as the consequences of temporal fluctuations are of fundamental importance. Recent developments in microbial ecology, which often combine traditional and modern approaches, have significantly furthered our understanding of the specific microniches and the metabolic and behavioral adaptations of microorganisms to life at the oxic-anoxic interface. New concepts help to define the targets of future studies: the spatial organization of microbial populations, their microenvironments and in situ activities, and the functional interactions within structured microbial communities.","pdfUrls":["http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~meech/a740/2004/fall/papers/Brune00.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0190d6642c7fe11e18812ee45652ba6c42e2317d","title":"Life at the oxic-anoxic interface: microbial activities and adaptations.","venue":"FEMS microbiology reviews","year":2000}

Three essential subunits of the motor are known: mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70); the peripheral membrane protein Tim44; and the nucleotide exchange factor Mge1. We have identified the fourth essential subunit of the PAM, an essential inner membrane protein of 18 kD with a J-domain that stimulates the ATPase activity of mtHsp70. The novel J-protein (encoded by PAM18/YLR008c/TIM14) is required for the interaction of mtHsp70 with Tim44 and protein translocation into the matrix. We conclude that the reaction cycle of the PAM of mitochondria involves an essential J-protein.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/10/59/J_Cell_Biol_2003_Nov_24_163(4)_707-713.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/019196a3d0c73089c2407e35277d671005ed37fc","title":"A J-protein is an essential subunit of the presequence translocase–associated protein import motor of mitochondria","venue":"The Journal of cell biology","year":2003}

LDAs popularity derives from its simplicity and its competitive classification performance, which has been reported for various types of neuroimaging data. Yet the standard LDA approach proves less than optimal for binary classification problems when additional label information (i.e. subclass labels) is present. Subclass labels allow to model structure in the data, which can be used to facilitate the classification task. In this paper, we illustrate how neuroimaging data exhibit subclass labels that may contain valuable information. We also show that the standard LDA classifier is unable to exploit subclass labels. We introduce a novel method that allows subclass labels to be incorporated efficiently into the classifier. The novel method, which we call Relevance Subclass LDA (RSLDA), computes an individual classification hyperplane for each subclass. It is based on regularized estimators of the subclass mean and uses other subclasses as regularization targets. We demonstrate the applicability and performance of our method on data drawn from two different neuroimaging modalities: (I) EEG data from brain-computer interfacing with event-related potentials, and (II) fMRI data in response to different levels of visual motion. We show that RSLDA outperforms the standard LDA approach for both types of datasets. These findings illustrate the benefits of exploiting subclass structure in neuroimaging data. Finally, we show that our classifier also outputs regularization profiles, enabling researchers to interpret the subclass structure in a meaningful way. RSLDA therefore yields increased classification accuracy as well as a better interpretation of neuroimaging data. Since both results are highly favorable, we suggest to apply RSLDA for various classification problems within neuroimaging and beyond.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.09.031"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01929bdd217b41d7a85b25231d2f784d16ab51f4","title":"Analyzing neuroimaging data with subclasses: A shrinkage approach","venue":"NeuroImage","year":2016}

Secondly, a retrospective chart review of neonates presenting to the ED with a diagnosis of neonatal mastitis or breast engorgement from July 2000 to December 2009 was conducted to assess how such patients were actually treated.\n\n\nRESULTS\n46/107 surveys were returned, with a wide discrepancy in how clinicians would treat neonatal mastitis: 4.3% would perform a full sepsis work up, including lumbar puncture, followed by IV antibiotics and hospital admission; 28% chose discharge on oral antibiotics; and 28% suggested admission only if blood work was abnormal. From the chart review, 33 neonates were diagnosed with possible neonatal mastitis over a 9-year period: 12 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 8 (66%) were admitted and treated with intravenous antibiotics, 2 (16.6%) were treated with oral antibiotics, and 2 (16.6%) did not receive antibiotics. None of the 12 patients had lumbar puncture performed.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThere is significant disagreement among clinicians regarding the best way to treat the well-looking neonate with localized mastitis.

Some forms of neurodegenerative illness are associated with mutations in genes which control assembly of disease related proteins. For example, the mouse sticky mutation sti, which results in undetected mischarging of tRNA(Ala) with serine resulting in the substitution of serine for alanine in proteins causes cerebellar Purkinje cell loss and ataxia in laboratory animals. Replacement of serine 422 with glutamic acid in tau increases the propensity of tau aggregation associated with neurodegeneration. However, the possibility that environmental factors can trigger abnormal folding in proteins remains relatively unexplored. We here report that a non-protein amino acid, β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), can be misincorporated in place of L-serine into human proteins. We also report that this misincorporation can be inhibited by L-serine. Misincorporation of BMAA into human neuroproteins may shed light on putative associations between human exposure to BMAA produced by cyanobacteria and an increased incidence of ALS.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/da/f7/pone.0075376.PMC3783393.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01951e2965eb070db01999a0b7ef1f11bd56e14c","title":"The Non-Protein Amino Acid BMAA Is Misincorporated into Human Proteins in Place of l-Serine Causing Protein Misfolding and Aggregation","venue":"PloS one","year":2013}

Alternatively, it might be similar to the prominent superstring theories with nine flat space dimensions or to the supersymmetric anti-deSitter model that seems to be equivalent to a conformal field theory.

To determine the relative contributions of the central clock and the hepatocyte circadian clock in modulating the chronotoxicity of APAP, we used a conditional null allele of brain and muscle Arnt-like 1 (Bmal1, aka Mop3 or Arntl) allowing deletion of the clock from hepatocytes while keeping the central and other peripheral clocks (e.g., the clocks controlling food intake) intact.

In contrast to existing analyses of dynamic and/or nonlinear taxation problems, we relax the assumptions that taxes are set by a benevolent government and that there is commitment to policies. Instead, in our model economy taxes are set by a self-interested pohtician, without any commitment power. This politician is partly controlled by the citizens via elections. The resulting environment is one of a dynamic mechanism design without commitment. We focus on the best sustainable mechanisrn, which is the mechanism that maximizes the ex ante utilitj' of the citizens. Towards a full characterization of the allocations implied by the best sustainable mechanism, we first prove that a version of the revelation principle applies in our environment and that attention can be restricted to direct truth-telling mechanisms. Using this result, we prove that the provision of incentives to politicians can be separated from the provision of incentives to, and from redistribution, across individuals. This also enables us to develop a method of characterizing the best sustainable mechanism as a, solution to a sta.ndard dyna.mic mechanism design problem subject to additional political economy and commitment constraints formulated only as functions of aggregate variables. Using this formulation, we provide conditions under which distortions created by political economy and commitment problems persist or disappear in the long run. In particular, if politicians are as patient as (or more pa.tient than) the citizens, these distortions disappear asymptotically, and they remain positive otherwise. Finally, we extend our analysis to the case where the government cares both about its own consumption and the future utility of the citizens. This extension generalizes our results to environments where the key constraint is the time-inconsistency of a (partially) benevolent government.

The establishment and maintenance of mixed chimerism may enable long-term engraftment of organ transplants while minimizing the use of immunosuppressants. Several protocols for inducing mixed chimerism have been reported; however, the exact mechanism underlying the development of immune tolerance remains to be elucidated. Therefore, understanding the kinetics of engraftment during early post-transplant period may provide insight into establishing long-term mixed chimerism and permanent transplant tolerance. In this study, we intentionally induced allogeneic mixed chimerism using a nonmyeloablative regimen by host natural killer (NK) cell depletion and T cell-depleted bone marrow (BM) grafts in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched murine model and analyzed the kinetics of donor (C57BL/6) and recipient (BALB/c) engraftment in the weeks following transplantation. Donor BM cells were well engrafted and stabilized without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as early as one week post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Donor-derived thymic T cells were reconstituted four weeks after BMT; however, the emergence of newly developed T cells was more obvious at the periphery as early as two weeks after BMT. Also, the emergence and changes in ratio of recipient- and donor-derived NKT cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells were noted after BMT. Here, we report a longitudinal analysis of the development of donor- and recipient-originated hematopoietic cells in various lymphatic tissues of intentionally induced mixed chimerism mouse model during early post-transplant period. Through the understanding of immune reconstitution at early time points after nonmyeloablative BMT, we suggest guidelines on intentionally inducing durable mixed chimerism.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/54/06/pone.0126318.PMC4427480.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/019cae6360ae5aa0d6e72cb36811e41113d68e6b","title":"Immune Reconstitution Kinetics following Intentionally Induced Mixed Chimerism by Nonmyeloablative Transplantation","venue":"PloS one","year":2015}

Protocol complex connectivity is important since a (k − 1)-connected protocol complex does not admit solutions for the k-set agreement problem. In crash-failure systems, the connectivity upper bound is ⌊t/k⌋ rounds, therefore, in Byzantine systems, the ambiguity in the communication can potentially persist for one extra round, delaying the solution to k-set agreement and other related problems. Additionally, we show that our connectivity bound is tight, at least when n+1, the number of processes, is suitably large compared to t. We solve a formulation of k-set agreement appropriate for Byzantine systems in ⌈t/k⌉ + 1 rounds. Essentially, we see that Byzantine failures can potentially require us one extra round to handle ambiguity, and, in specific cases, at most that.","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04224v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04224v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04224","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04224v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04224v2.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/019f83818663a71a6afbf07e5ae8da9b4d84c6e7","title":"Tight Bounds for Connectivity and Set Agreement in Byzantine Synchronous Systems","venue":"ArXiv","year":2015}

From October 1995 to March 2004, 25 patients who had one or more neuropsychological symptoms preoperatively and were followed up 1 year after parathyroidectomy were enrolled. The subjective symptoms were identified using questionnaires distributed to patients; eight questions were used to determine the presence or absence of psychoneurological symptoms. Compared to their preoperative status, patients responded that their general health perceptions 1 year after surgery were improved (13 cases, 52%), unchanged (11 cases, 44%), or aggravated (1 case, 4%). There were no statistically significant differences in the patients' responses before and after surgery with respect to individual neuropsychological symptoms, such as \"tiring easily, \"forgetfulness,\" \"decreased concentration,\" \"depression,\" \"irritability,\" \"uneasiness,\" and \"sleeplessness.\" Therefore, subjective neuropsychological symptoms did not improve in otherwise asymptomatic PHPT patients following parathyroidectomy.

Abnormally high TCD velocities were recorded in 35 patients; in 20 this was deemed to be due to vasospasm and in the other 15 to hyperemia. Patients who developed hyperemia also had the highest intracranial pressure (ICP) and the lowest cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) of the three groups. Outcome was assessed at six months after injury using the Glasgow outcome scale and the disability rating scale. In the normal velocity group 87% of patients had a good outcome, compared with 47% of those with hyperemia and 40% of those with vasospasm. The highest velocity (HVEL), GCS, age, ICP and CPP were entered into a logistic regression analysis. HVEL, age and CPP were found to be the most significant predictors of outcome (chi 2 = 29.5; p < 0.0001). These factors predicted outcome with 82% accuracy, 86% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Routine monitoring of TCD velocity may be useful in detecting hyperemia and vasospasm after severe head injury, allowing appropriate treatment to be started as early as possible.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01a988315fc4577e9986f975c35956385dc454c4","title":"Incidence and effects of increased cerebral blood flow velocity after severe head injury: a transcranial Doppler ultrasound study II.

These clones, groups of cells that share common ancestry, proliferate without restriction causing disease relapse. Tumours contain a host of cancer clones that are genetically and epigenetically different from one another [1]. These clones follow a Darwinian process of somatic selection where they compete for space and resources within their microenvironments [2]. Cancer cells acquire mutations over time that affect their fitness, giving some clones a survival advantage over others [3]. Chemotherapy itself is a selective pressure that influences tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution. Most cancer deaths are caused by clones that are therapeutically resistant [3]. The evolution of resistant clones occurs rapidly, resulting in the appearance of new clones that are not susceptible to conventional therapy. Evolutionary principles describe the process of clonal evolution and aid in formulating novel strategies for disease management and prognosis [4]. An understanding of tumour heterogeneity and clone fitness is key to developing better treatment options. Intra-tumoural genetic variability and instability affect the process of somatic evolution [4]. Variations in the tumour microenviron-ment, including nutrient availability and blood supply access, drive clone evolution in both the presence and absence of chemotherapeutic drugs [3, 5]. The more genetic or environmental variation there is, the greater the likelihood that some clones will develop a survival advantage over others [4]. In some instances, resistant clones can cooperate with one another in ways that promote their survival [6], leading to faster cancer progression or increased aggressiveness. When chemo-sensitive cells are killed, space and resources become abundantly available to resistant clones, which then proliferate without inhibition by neighbouring cells. Understanding clonal evolution and the pressures that select for resistant clones can inform the development of new therapeutic approaches. With the advent of molecular data and computational frameworks, alternate strategies are being investigated to manipulate the microenvironment to control and contain tumours [5, 7]. Genetic profiling of tumour progression over time allows analysis of DNA methylation patterns and base pair mutations of clones, linking the evolution of clones to specific genetic events [8]. Single cell analysis helps in understanding tumour progression and intra-tumoural heterogeneity [9], and next-generation sequencing uncovers genetic complexities in individual clones [3, 10]. Mathematical and computational modelling provides frameworks for determining vital mutations and microenvironmental changes, bridging the gap between laboratory data and clinical information [7, 9, 11].

However, pain severely compromises the quality of life in nearly 70% of SCI patients. The principal aim of this study was to assess the contribution of Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) to SCI pain. TNF-alpha blockers have already been successfully used to treat inflammatory disorders but there are few studies on its effect on neuropathic pain, especially following SCI. Following T13 spinal cord hemisection, we examined the effects on mechanical allodynia and microglial activation of immediate and delayed chronic intrathecal treatment with etanercept, a fusion protein blocker of TNF-alpha. Immediate treatment (starting at the time of injury) with etanercept resulted in markedly reduced mechanical allodynia 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after SCI. Delayed treatment had no effect. Immediate etanercept treatment also reduced spinal microglial activation assessed by OX-42 immunostaining, a putative marker of activated microglia. To assess whether the effects of etanercept were mediated via decreased microglial activation, we examined the effects of the microglial inhibitor, minocycline which significantly reduced the development of pain behaviours at 1 and 2 weeks after SCI compared to saline treatment. Minocycline also significantly reduced microglial OX-42 expression. Furthermore, minocycline decreased the expression of noxious-stimulation-induced c-Fos, suggesting an effect on evoked neuronal activity. This study demonstrates that TNF-alpha plays an important role in the establishment of neuropathic pain following SCI, seemingly dependent on microglial activation. Pharmacological targeting of TNF-alpha may offer therapeutic opportunities for treating SCI pain.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01ac940fd466e827b1479ce3ff8bbd904df39099","title":"Effects of Etanercept and Minocycline in a rat model of spinal cord injury.","venue":"European journal of pain","year":2009}

These games are intended to simulate a situation where a newly emergent market opportunity may be fruitfully exploited by no more than a fixed and commonly known number of firms. Our results indicate a high degree of sensitivity to the game parameters that are manipulated in the study, namely, the market capacity, entry fee, and method of subject assignment to groups (fixed vs. random), as well as sophisticated adaptation to actual and hypothetical changes in wealth level. We find no support for convergence to equilibrium play on either the aggregate or individual level or for any trend across rounds of play to maximize total group payoff by lowering the frequency of entry. The coordination failure is attributed to certain features of the payoff function that induce strong competition in the attempt to penetrate the market.","pdfUrls":["http://128.118.178.162/eps/exp/papers/9903/9903001.pdf","http://home.ust.hk/~mkzwick/papers/mefc.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01b07b3e240e84ade04dc98f8254aa70b4759109","title":"Tacit Coordination in a Decentralized Market Entry Game with Fixed Capacity","venue":"","year":1999}

Therefore, certain cell populations such as monocytes are attractive targets for use in molecular imaging and cell imaging, e.g. after labelling with radionuclides, as well as for cell therapies. However, the preparation of monocytes may require freezing and thawing to preserve cells for timely and standardised applications. Additional modifications of these cells such as radioisotope labelling are necessary prior to their application in vivo. We therefore tested the hypothesis whether cryopreservation of freshly isolated circulating human monocytes affects their functional phenotype or their suitability for radionuclide labelling.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCD14+CD16- monocytes were isolated from human peripheral blood. They were either directly used for cellular assays and labelling or frozen down using cryoprotectants. In the latter case, cells were thawed prior to further use and analysed for survival, chemotactic responses to various growth factors and adhesion on endothelial cells. In addition, both fresh and cryopreserved monocytes were labelled with radiotracers followed by assessment of survival and chemotactic responses. In all functional assays performed, cryopreserved monocytes did not significantly differ from freshly isolated monocytes with regard to their functionality. Cryopreservation did not affect cell survival. There was no effect on the chemotactic response of monocytes towards different growth factors. Likewise, adhesion properties remained unchanged following cryopreservation. Moreover, the labelling efficiency was similar for freshly isolated and cryopreserved monocytes. Labelling did not negatively affect monocyte survival and function.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data indicate that cryopreservation of freshly isolated human primary monocytes is feasible and does not negatively affect their functionality when used for labelling and functional assessment.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01bbdf017de903436cb89bebca52b23c35716f99","title":"Cryopreservation of primary human monocytes does not negatively affect their functionality or their ability to be labelled with radionuclides: basis for molecular imaging and cell therapy","venue":"EJNMMI research","year":2016}

One of the challenges of such sites is, however, to prevent video clips that violate copyrights by illegally copying and editing scenes from other videos. Due to the sheer number of clips uploaded every day, automatic methods to detect (illegally) copied video clips in a large collection are desirable. Toward this problem, in this paper, we present a novel framework, termed as Video Linkage, that is based on the record linkage techniques. Our proposal is based on the observations that: (1) a video clip can be represented as a \"group\" of key frames, (2) two video clips are deemed to be similar if two groups of key frames are similar as a whole - i.e., the similarity of two video clips can be measured by means of graph-based similarity measures such as maximal cardinality bipartite matching, and (3) if a video clip <i>v<sub>a</sub></i> is copied to <i>v<sub>b</sub></i>, then <i>v<sub>a</sub></i> and <i>v<sub>b</sub></i> must be somehow similar, but not all similar video clips are illegally copied ones - i.e., <i>similar</i> videos can be used as a filter for fast detection of <i>copied</i> videos. The validity of our observations and Video Linkage technique is thoroughly evaluated using both real and synthetic data sets - i.e., on average, our proposals achieved 0.94 as precision and 0.93 as recall across 10 genres and 6 editing patterns.","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1386352.1386404","http://nike.psu.edu/publications/civr08.pdf","http://pike.psu.edu/publications/civr08.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01bccad7079408193858f922295aaf3ddb539ba1","title":"Video linkage: group based copied video detection","venue":"CIVR","year":2008}

Methods: Film-based slit lamp images taken at baseline and at five and ten-year follow-up examinations of the Beaver Dam Eye Study cohort were digitized, and optical traces were taken along an axis through the center of the cornea and lens. Four indices of the severity of sclerosis were calculated based on the optical densities. The associations of the original Beaver Dam grades and these indices to age, vision, and subsequent change in severity of sclerosis over two subsequent visits were compared. Results: At baseline photographs, the Spearman correlation between age and severity was 0.65 for the original film-based grading (n = 9518 right eyes) and varied between 0.46 to 0.71 for the measures from digitized images. Correlations of the indices to visual acuity were 0.38 for the film-based grading and ranged from 0.32 to 0.38 for the other indices. Our assumption is that nuclear sclerosis does not regress and percent regression is a reflection of error in grading. Percent regression and progression of sclerosis over a five and a ten year interval was determined for each index. After five years, 48.2% progressed and 4.9% regressed using the Beaver Dam grades; progression occurred in 4.9% to 9.9%, and regression occurred in 4.5% to 7.0% for the other indices. After ten years, 61.9% progressed and 3.2% regressed using the Beaver Dam grades; progression occurred in 8.0% to 19.7%, and regression occurred in 2.6% to 9.7% for the other indices. Conclusion: Semi-automated grading of the digitized images can be used to process thousands of images with little oversight by a trained grader. Indices of sclerosis that closely parallel human grading in their relationships to age and to visual acuity can be easily computed. However, the indices appear to identify significantly less progression of nuclear sclerosis compared to human grading.","pdfUrls":["http://vger.aa.washington.edu/~dklein/papers/DetectingProgressionofNS_KleinB.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01bce78395fa5b63d17f43e97a632b8170655690","title":"Detecting Progression of Nuclear Sclerosis Human Grading versus Semi-automated Computer Grading","venue":"","year":2006}

Cultures of human bone-marrow derived MSCs were infected with 5 x 10(2) viral particles/cell of Ad.BMP-2, or Ad.BMP-4, seeded into aggregates and cultured for three weeks in a defined, serum-free medium. Untransduced cells or cultures transduced with marker genes served as controls. Expression of BMP-2 and BMP-4 was determined by ELISA, and aggregates were analyzed histologically, immunohistochemically, biochemically and by RT-PCR for chondrogenesis and hypertrophy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLevels of BMP-2 and BMP-4 in the media were initially 30 to 60 ng/mL and declined thereafter. BMP-4 and BMP-2 genes were equipotent inducers of chondrogenesis in primary MSCs as judged by lacuna formation, strong staining for proteoglycans and collagen type II, increased levels of GAG synthesis, and expression of mRNAs associated with the chondrocyte phenotype. However, BMP-4 modified aggregates showed a lower tendency to progress towards hypertrophy, as judged by expression of alkaline phosphatase, annexin 5, immunohistochemical staining for type X collagen protein, and lacunar size.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBMP-2 and BMP-4 were equally effective in provoking chondrogenesis by primary human MSCs in pellet culture.

Atypical antipsychotics have emerged as both an alternative and adjunct to conventional mood stabilisers. The manic phase of the illness is the best studied, and it appears that a class effect with regards to efficacy is present in both monotherapy and augmentation studies. Evidence for efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in depression is emerging. At this stage controlled data are available for both olanzapine and quetiapine. Maintenance data demonstrating efficacy are available for olanzapine. Atypical antipsychotics have utility in treating acute agitation and aggression in manic episodes of bipolar disorder. Subgroup analyses from trials treating manic phase bipolar disorder, and an open-label study of rapid cycling, have suggested that atypical antipsychotics may be useful for the treatment of mixed states and rapid cycling. Several studies have suggested that atypical antipsychotics may be useful in treatment-refractory episodes of bipolar disorder. The current available data suggest greater efficacy of the atypical antipsychotics in mania than in depression, although the data are fairly clear that induction of depression is not an issue with the atypical antipsychotics. A number of trials are underway that will hopefully address many of the questions still pending.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01be3c3da6de38ce5708027fb51c2e2dd8bcb661","title":"Efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in bipolar disorder.","venue":"Drugs","year":2005}

All patients underwent a systematic evaluation to assess the primary cause of suboptimal outcome including lead position, hardware integrity, patient selection, patient expectations, effective use of stimulation settings, and pre- and postoperative levodopa responsive symptoms. The data was also analyzed by duration of stimulation to determine if these factors varied by stage of DBS management.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur series included patients implanted 4-68 months. We identified the following primary factors impacting outcome: Suboptimal stimulation settings (52%), disease progression (16%), inappropriate patient selection (10%), hardware damage (8%), lead malposition (8%), met expected motor outcomes (6%). Lead revision surgery occurred in 14%. Reversible factors accounted for dissatisfaction in 74%. Suboptimal stimulation was the dominant factor affecting outcomes in early and long-term management phases.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSTN DBS outcomes can be improved even years after implantation.

The method of proof involves representing such groups in PSL2(C) and is a refinement of a technique of Baumslag, Morgan and Shalen. The technique allows the extension of the Freiheitssatz result to many additional one-relator products. 1. Introduction. A one-relator product of a family of groups (A¿), i G /, is the quotient (*A¿)/7V(ií) where R is a cyclically reduced word and iV(ß) is its normal closure in the free product *¿A¿. R is called the relator. A one-relator group is just a one-relator product of free groups. In general one-relator products share many properties with one-relator groups [3]. In the present paper we give a version of the Freiheitssatz for a certain class of one-relator products of cyclic groups. In particular we show that if each A¿ is cyclic and the relator is a proper power then the subgroup generated by any proper subset of the generators is the obvious free product of cyclics. This answers a conjecture of J. Howie [3]. The method of proof involves representing such groups in PSL2(C) and is a refinement of a technique of Baumslag, Morgan and Shalen [1]. This technique was used in [1] to investigate the class of generalized triangle groups which in the present context can be described as one-relator products of two cyclic groups. The technique actually yields a stronger result—a Freiheitssatz for one-relator products of groups which admit faithful representation in PSL2(C).","pdfUrls":["http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1988-102-02/S0002-9939-1988-0920981-1/S0002-9939-1988-0920981-1.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01c6e5d663f049e1110220eaf84dc9ecfd40bc06","title":"One-relator Quotients and Free Products of Cyclics","venue":"","year":2010}

We examined BPA exposure in 491 pregnant women from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) cohort and explored the role of living in the United States on significant dietary predictors of BPA exposure. Women provided urine samples up to two times during pregnancy (n=866 total samples). We computed the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to evaluate variability in concentrations between collections and used generalized estimating equation (GEE) models to assess predictors of exposure. Geometric mean (GSD) BPA concentrations were 0.9 (2.8)μg/L and 1.0 (2.6)μg/L at the first and second prenatal visits, respectively. We observed greater within- than between-woman variability in urinary BPA concentrations (ICC=0.22). GEE models suggest that women who lived in the United States their entire life had 38% (CI: -0.1, 89.3) higher urinary BPA concentrations compared with other immigrant women. Additionally, women who consumed ≥3 sodas per day or hamburgers three times a week or more had 58% (CI: 18.0, 112.1) and 20% (CI: -0.2, 45.2) higher urinary BPA concentrations, respectively, compared with women who consumed no sodas or hamburgers. A higher percentage of women who lived their entire life in the United States reported increased consumption of sodas and hamburgers compared with other immigrant women. Independent of other factors, BPA urinary concentrations were slightly higher when the sample was collected later in the day. As in previous studies, high within-woman variability in urinary BPA concentrations confirms that several samples are needed to properly characterize exposure during pregnancy. Results also suggest that some factors could be modified to minimize exposures during pregnancy in our study participants (e.g., reducing soda and hamburger intake) and that factors associated with acculturation might increase BPA concentrations.","pdfUrls":["http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/18872/Quiros-Alcala%202013_Determinants%20of%20BPA%20Among%20Pregnant%20Women.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01c80699cd96020b33fa4105e2d1756546cc6b45","title":"Determinants of urinary bisphenol A concentrations in Mexican/Mexican--American pregnant women.","venue":"Environment international","year":2013}

Presenting symptoms and laboratory test results were studied according to the extension of the lesion into the cochlea (C) and vestibule (V), on one hand, and according to unifocal (L1) or plurifocal (L2) extension into the labyrinth, on the other.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIntracochlear type was more common (50%) than vestibular (19.1%) and more diffuse forms (30.9%). The mean delay for diagnosis was long (72.5 mo; SD, 76.6). Mean age was 53.9 years (SD, 13.2). Deafness was the most common symptom (77.8 dB HL [SD, 33.6], with only 24.6% of patients keeping viable hearing. Caloric tests (65.5% of patients) were abnormal in 77.8% of cases. c-VEMPs were abnormal in 65.7% of the 36 cases analyzed. In V forms, hearing was significantly better (class A + B in 21.1% in C and 45.8% in V forms) (p = 0.03), and vestibular function was more altered (C: 57%, V: 100%, p = 0.0009*).

This historical cohort study was designed to investigate the prognostic factors for death from VL in Belo Horizonte (Brazil).\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe analysis was based on data of the Reportable Disease Information System-SINAN (Brazilian Ministry of Health) relating to the clinical manifestations of the disease. During the study period (2002-2009), the SINAN changed platform from a Windows to a Net-version that differed with respect to some of the parameters collected. Multivariate logistic regression models were performed to identify variables associated with death from VL, and these were included in prognostic score.\n\n\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nModel 1 (period 2002-2009; 111 deaths from VL and 777 cured patients) included the variables present in both SINAN versions, whereas Model 2 (period 2007-2009; 49 deaths from VL and 327 cured patients) included variables common to both SINAN versions plus the additional variables included in the Net version. In Model 1, the variables significantly associated with a greater risk of death from VL were weakness (OR 2.9; 95%CI 1.3-6.4), Leishmania-HIV co-infection (OR 2.4; 95%CI 1.2-4.8) and age ≥60 years (OR 2.5; 95%CI 1.5-4.3). In Model 2, the variables were bleeding (OR 3.5; 95%CI 1.2-10.3), other associated infections (OR 3.2; 95%CI 1.3-7.8), jaundice (OR 10.1; 95%CI 3.7-27.2) and age ≥60 years (OR 3.1; 95%CI 1.4-7.1). The prognosis score was developed using the variables associated with death from VL of the latest version of the SINAN (Model 2). The predictive performance of which was evaluated by sensitivity (71.4%), specificity (73.7%), positive and negative predictive values (28.9% and 94.5%) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (75.6%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nKnowledge regarding the factors associated with death from VL may improve clinical management of patients and contribute to lower mortality.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01cd48d98a7c8307077bc02466cca1057275b8cd","title":"Early Clinical Manifestations Associated with Death from Visceral Leishmaniasis","venue":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","year":2012}

Previous attempts at quantifying NIS invasions have mostly taken \" bottom-up \" approaches that eventually require the use of multiple simplifying assumptions due to insufficiency and/or uncertainty of available data. By modeling implicit species exchanges via a graph abstraction that we refer to as the Species Flow Network (SFN), a different approach that exploits the power of network science methods in extracting knowledge from largely incomplete data is presented. Here, coarse-grained species flow dynamics are studied via a graph clustering approach that decomposes the SFN to clusters of ports and inter-cluster connections. With this decomposition of ports in place, NIS flow among clusters can be very efficiently reduced by enforcing NIS management on a few chosen inter-cluster connections. Furthermore, efficient NIS management strategy for species exchanges within a cluster (often difficult due higher rate of travel and pathways) are then derived in conjunction with ecological and environmental aspects that govern the species establishment. The benefits of the presented approach include robustness to data uncertainties, implicit incorporation of \" stepping-stone \" spread of invasive species, and decoupling of species spread and establishment risk estimation. Our analysis of a multi-year (1997–2006) GSN dataset using the presented approach shows the existence of a few large clusters of ports with higher intra-cluster species flow that are fairly stable over time. Furthermore, detailed investigations were carried out on vessel types, ports, and inter-cluster connections. Finally, our observations are discussed in the context of known NIS invasions and future research directions are also presented.","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.5407v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5407"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01ce61ecfac8a7daf969262e56e7a05cc5cfc82e","title":"Patterns of Ship-borne Species Spread: A Clustering Approach for Risk Assessment and Management of Non-indigenous Species Spread","venue":"ArXiv","year":2014}

The knot points are considered to be independent variables in the B-spline network and are optimized together with the B-spline expansion coefficients. The simulated annealing algorithm with an appropriate search strategy is used as an optimization algorithm for the training process in order to avoid any possible local minima.

Although the unique properties of ad hoc networks make them very sensitive to malicious faults (attacks), most of current research has focused on improving their routing capabilities , thus widening their application domains, and very little attention has been devoted to their dependability. Accordingly, the confident use of this technology requires the development of new techniques and tools to assess the robustness of such networks in presence of attacks. This paper deals with this challenging goal by proposing an attack injection approach based on real ad hoc networks as experimental platform.

The aim of the present investigation was to analyze the influence of these two factors on the social experiences of students in secondary school. The presence of aggressive behavior was determined by means of peer ratings and self-ratings. Classroom climate, i.e. the quality of the sense of community in a class, was considered as a modifying factor. In a first step, from 96 classes in the first and third grades of secondary school two extreme groups of 24 classes each were formed on the basis of student evaluations of the cohesion in the class and the frequency of aggressive arguments between students. At this time the students also rated other aspects of their social experiences at school. In a second step, sociometric data were obtained in the selected classes on the most liked and least liked classmates and on certain behaviors to determine the social position of the students in their peer group and their involvement in aggressive arguments. The social experiences attitudes and values of the students were highly correlated with the frequency of their involvement in aggressive arguments. There were some marked discrepancies between peer ratings and self-ratings of behavior, but both types of rating appear to have some clinical relevance. Beside the social status in the peer group the classroom climate had considerable impact on the social experiences of aggressive children. In addition, there were indications that the classroom climate plays a role in the social status of aggressive students in the class.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01d2a3c2e51589eef81fd90749e0c41a66fe8f56","title":"[Aggressiveness and social status in the class social structure].","venue":"Zeitschrift für Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie","year":1997}

The objective is to find a permutation of the customers (an a priori tour) that minimizes the expected distance traveled by the vehicle. Since the objective function is computationally demanding, effective approximations of it could improve the algorithms' performance. We show that a good choice is using the length of the a priori tour as a fast approximation of the objective, to be used in the local search of the several metaheuristics analyzed. We also show that for the instances tested, our metaheuristics find better solutions with respect to a known effective heuristic and with respect to solving the problem as two related deterministic problems.","pdfUrls":["http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~mbiro/Paperi/BiaBirChi-etal2004ppsn.pdf","http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~mbiro/paperi/BiaBirChi-etal2004ppsn.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01d3a212e91014a1db96573ef42d31f5aabf4252","title":"Metaheuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Demands","venue":"","year":2004}

Abstract This study compares the profitability of security recommendations issued by investment banks and independent research firms. During the 1996 through mid-2003 time period, the average daily abnormal return to independent research firm buy recommendations exceeds that of the investment banks by 3.1 basis points, or almost 8 percentage points annualized. In contrast, investment bank hold and sell recommendations outperform those of independent research firms by-1.8 basis points daily, or-4½ percentage points annualized. Investment bank buy recommendation underperformance is concentrated in the subperiod subsequent to the NASDAQ market peak (March 10, 2000), where it averages 6.9 basis points per day, or slightly more than 17 percent annualized. More strikingly, during this period those investment bank buy recommendations outstanding subsequent to equity offerings underperform those of independent research firms by 8.7 basis points (almost 22 percent annualized). Taken as a whole, these results suggest that at least part of the underperformance of investment bank buy recommendations is due to a reluctance to downgrade stocks whose prospects dimmed during the early 2000's bear market, as claimed in the SEC's Global Research Analyst Settlement. Additional analyses find that the underperformance of investment bank buy recommendations extends not only to the ten investment banks sanctioned in the research settlement but to the non-sanctioned investment banks as well. The press release specifies that \" For a five-year period, each of the firms will be required to contract with no fewer than three independent research firms that will make available independent research to the firm's customers. \"","pdfUrls":["http://warrington.ufl.edu/fire/docs/msf/speaker/prereading_McMahon_Ward0405.pdf","http://www.cba.ufl.edu/fire/docs/msf/speaker/prereading_mcmahon_ward0405.pdf","http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/documents/areas/fac/accounting/research.pdf","http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/Documents/areas/fac/accounting/trueman_comparing.pdf","http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/documents/areas/fac/accounting/trueman_18.pdf","http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/sites/faculty-research/files/accounting/LEHAVY.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01d6bb335a8b43dee522e45f6d1ebb8c5b182d8d","title":"Comparing the Stock Recommendation Performance of Investment Banks and Independent Research Firms Comparing the Stock Recommendation Performance of Investment Banks and Independent Research Firms","venue":"","year":2004}

We show that the Rabi oscillation controlled rates exhibit a spectrum with three frequency components. When exchange J is stronger than the driving field R (in the frequency units), the frequency components of the Rabi oscillation do not depend on J , rather they are determined by the relation between the R and D. We derive analytical expressions for the frequencies and the intensities of all three Rabi oscillation components as functions of R /D and δ/D, where δ is detuning of the driving ac field from the Larmor frequency. When R D, the two lower frequencies approach s = R , while the upper line approaches s = 2 R. Disorder of the local Larmor frequencies leads to a Gaussian broadening of the spectral lines. We calculate corresponding widths for different R /D and δ/D. Unexpectedly, we find that one of the frequency components exhibits an unusual evolution with R : its frequency decreases with R at R < D. Upon further increase of R , this frequency then passes through a minimum and, eventually, approaches s = R. Nonmonotonic behavior of the frequencies is accompanied by nonmonotonic behavior of the respective oscillation intensity.","pdfUrls":["http://www.physics.utah.edu/~hpgas/pubs/Glenn_2013_2.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01d6d0aee734b7ec0f7d610bb11bdf5eca2467c0","title":"Analytical Study of Spin-dependent Transition Rates within Pairs of Dipolar and Strongly Exchange Coupled Spins with S = during Magnetic Resonant Excitation","venue":"","year":2013}

the ambient intelligence vision means that consumers will be provided with universal and immediate access to available content and services, together with ways of effectively exploiting them. Concentrating on the software system development aspect, this means that the actual implementation of any ambient intelligence application requested by a user can only be resolved at runtime according to the user's specific situation. This paper introduces a base declarative language and associated core middleware, which supports the abstract specification of Ambient Intelligence applications together with their dynamic composition according to the environment. The proposed solution builds on the Web services architecture, whose pervasiveness enables both services availability in most environments, and specification of applications supporting automated retrieval and composition. In addition, dynamic composition of applications is dealt in a way that enforces the quality of service of deployed applications in terms of security and performance.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.uoi.gr/~zarras/mdw-ws/presentations-2007/issarny_mse_jase.pdf","http://www-rocq.inria.fr/arles/doc/WSAMIjase.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicole_Levy/publication/29598091_Developing_Ambient_Intelligence_Systems_A_Solution_based_on_Web_Services/links/0912f50c0d07d630d7000000.pdf","http://cedric.cnam.fr/~sailhanf/publications/WSAMIjase.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:AUSE.0000049210.42738.00","http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/41/49/51/PDF/IssarnySTSCLT05.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01d959b67fabd69f4ae3983eef0b8c21b50c3828","title":"Developing Ambient Intelligence Systems: A Solution based on Web Services","venue":"Autom.

We evaluate two hypotheses concerning the origins of syntactic bootstrapping effects. The \"universalist\" view, holding that syntactic bootstrapping falls out from universal properties of the syntax-semantics mapping, is shown to be superior to the \"emergentist\" view, which holds that argument structure patterns emerge from a process of categorization and generalization over the input. These theories diverge in their predictions about a language in which syntactic structure is not the most reliable cue to a certain meaning. In Kannada, causative morphology is a better predictor of causative meaning than transitivity is. Hence, the emergentist view predicts that Kannada-speaking children will associate causative morphology (in favor of transitive syntax) with causative meaning.

It is concluded that normal man has accurate perception of trunk rotation and that neck-spinal afferents carry a tonic signal with efficient access to the ocular motor system. A patient with absent vestibular function showed identical results to those of normal subjects; this suggests that the enhancement of the cervico-ocular reflex observed in such patients is not mediated by an increase in neck-spinal afferent sensitivity.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01dc26c84eee1901f8cc27d44e2c98e817623bbe","title":"Perception of neck rotation assessed by 'remembered saccades'.","venue":"Neuroreport","year":1993}

Traditional measures, which focus on what share of household disposable income or total budget goes to transportation services, often fail to consider the wide variation in households' transportation needs and locational settings. In this project, we propose a contextualized transportation affordability analysis framework that differentiates population groups based upon their socio-demographics, the built environment, and the policy environment. The necessity of such a context-sensitive framework is demonstrated via a case study of the Twin Cities metropolitan area, which shows heterogeneity among different population groups in terms of their transportation needs and resource availability. The proposed context-sensitive framework points to two dilemmas associated with transportation affordability. First, the socioeconomically disadvantaged group has the lowest auto ownership rate, yet its transportation needs are better served by automobiles. Second, while automobiles can reduce transportation hardship for the socioeconomically disadvantaged, the existing auto-oriented urban landscape in the U.S. requires more travel for access to destinations, which leads to higher transportation costs. The dilemmas call for a multi-modal transportation solution: reducing societal auto dependence and providing financial subsidies for car access among disadvantaged populations are equally important to enhance transportation affordability and social welfare.

It maintains airway patency, protects the lungs from aspiration, and permits leak-free ventilation during mechanical ventilation. The anesthesiologists' knowledge, technical skills and crisis management capabilities play an important role in controlling the occurrence of unwanted complications during airway management. 1 In anesthesiology, leaking cuff is one of the problems occurring after correct endotracheal intubation. It usually occurs when the cuff is damaged by contact with teeth, nasal bone or Magill forceps during mechanical ventilation in which the tracheal tube should be removed and replaced. In patients with impossible manipulation of the neck, injuries to the cervical vertebrae of their neck, or difficult intubation, it is necessary to use a fiberoptic bronchoscope for reintubation most of the times. Direct laryngoscope with Macintosh blade for intubation is the first selection in cases of difficult intubation. 2 Using laryngoscope produces reflex sympathetic stimulation, and subsequently increases heart rate, blood pressure, intracranial pressure, myocardial ischemia, and cardiac arrhythmia. Complications of airway problems often result in morbidity and mortality in anesthesia. 1 Inadequate cuff seal is common and leads to hypoventilation during mechanical ventilation and aspiration of gastric contents. The most common cause of reintubation during anesthesia in the operating room is upper airway obstruction and hypoventilation. Endotracheal tube cuff laceration during anesthesia is often associated with respiratory complications, reduction of arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation, and inappropriate ventilation of the lungs. Therefore, the exchange of endotracheal tube and proper replacement with an adequate tube plays an important role. Care must be taken to reduce neck manipulation, minimize use of laryngoscopy, and cause less sympathetic stimulation. Guide wire \" j \" tip catheter, which is a central venous catheter, is suggested for the exchange of a tracheal tube during anesthesia without using fiberoptic bronchoscope or laryngoscopy (figure 1). To exchange a tracheal tube during anesthesia in operating room without using fiberoptic bronchoscope or laryngoscopy, a flexible guide wire \" j \" tip is inserted into the previously perforated tube and the damaged tube is removed. Guide wire \" j \" tip remains in place, and a new tube is advanced over the guide wire \" j \" tip, and is correctly placed at the expected point. Then, guide wire \" j \" tip is removed slowly. After the evaluation of the lungs and ensuring adequate ventilation, the new tube is …","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01e01c074fd30ec015f1a6915a467f4dd952b89c","title":"Guide Wire J-Tip Technique for Easy Exchange of In Situ Endotracheal Tubes","venue":"Iranian journal of medical sciences","year":2012}

Even the spectral efficiency gains due to MIMO vanish for cell-edge users who are interference limited. Cooperative MIMO, which involves coordination amongst base stations serving adjacent cell-sites, is a promising technique to address the co-channel interference problem. In this paper, we study cooperation in the downlink of an interference channel. The basestations cooperate amongst themselves to arrive separately at precoding strategies which improve the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio of the cell-edge users and hence the throughput. We propose a distributed algorithm that independently determines the precoder which mitigates the interference to the neighboring cell edge users without compromising on the in-cell performance. This algorithm requires only modest levels of on-air-feedback and information exchange among the basestations on the backhaul networks. I. INTRODUCTION Cellular networks are interference-limited by their inherent nature. Spectrum scarcity and high user density per cell-site lead to deployments involving universal frequency re-use. The high spectral efficiency gains possible by employing MIMO vanish in the presence of inter-cell interference. The user equipments (UE) at the cell-edge suffer the most due to very low values of signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR). Hence efficient techniques are needed to mitigate interference. An overview of some of the well-known interference mitigation techniques is available in [1]. The multiple antennas employed in a MIMO system provide extra degrees of freedom for interference suppression [2], [3]. Cooperative MIMO techniques involving coordinated transmissions by adjacent cell-site base station (BS) antennas is a promising approach for improving the SINR of cell-edge users. Capacity analyses, under different sets of assumptions [4]–[7], suggest that this technique has significant merit. In one framework, where all the BS transmission points are connected to a central processing unit, and can perform coherent transmission based on channel state information (CSI), interference can be almost fully eliminated [4]–[6]. However, such a system may not be feasible in practice, considering the complexity involved and the large-scale coordination that needs to happen across the network. Moreover, this will necessitate a fundamental change to the existing cellular network architecture.","pdfUrls":["http://www.ncc.org.in/download.php?f=NCC2010/A5_2.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01e6b7d75496bdf72276bd8917281b16bd44ea50","title":"An Algorithm for Distributed Cooperative Precoder Selection in a Cellular Network","venue":"","year":2010}

The present study investigated the functional consequences of a lingual hemiparalysis on the symmetry and the grooving of the tongue in the coronal plane during the production of vowel-consonant-vowel sequences. The hypotheses were that, because of the lingual hemiparalysis, the stroke patients' tongue shapes would be (1) more asymmetrical and (2) less grooved than the tongues of the control speakers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe participants in this prospective data collection were 9 stroke patients with lingual hemiparalysis and 6 control speakers. All participants produced vowel-consonant-vowel sequences with the vowels [a, i, and u] and the target consonants [k, t, ∫, s, and r]. The tongue shape in the coronal plane was traced and measured. The outcome measures were asymmetry and midlingual concavity. The participants and controls were compared using repeated measures analyses of variance with post hoc Scheffé tests.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no significant differences in asymmetry. There was significantly reduced midlingual concavity for the stroke patients (F[1, 13] = 8.78; P < .05). There was also a within-subjects effect for consonant (F[4, 50] = 14.26; P < .01). Post hoc testing with Scheffé tests indicated that the consonant [k] had significantly lower grooving than the other consonant sounds (P < .05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe hemilateral paresis affected not the symmetry but the midlingual grooving. Residual ipsilateral innervation in the hemiparalyzed tongue may help patients compensate. More research is needed to assess the impact of the intrinsic deformation of the tongue on speech acceptability and intelligibility in patients with a lingual hemiparalysis.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01e6b8db7c526a7d1ef6120167903090441b5406","title":"An ultrasound investigation of tongue shape in stroke patients with lingual hemiparalysis.","venue":"Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association","year":2015}

To start filling that gap, we present a formal statistical testing of several hypotheses about the characteristics of 214 videos from Nereliatube.com posted from the inauguration of the site until Decem-ber 2010. We found that in most cases the video was made consensually and the camera was operated by the man. The most frequent practice shown was fellatio, followed by vaginal penetration. The great majority of videos showed the sexual interactions of one woman with one man; group sex was rare. Violence and manifestations of power were rare and when there was violence it was mostly simulated. Latin American user-submitted sexual videos in Nereliatube generally reflect a society in which women and men have a variety of sexual practices that are mostly consensual and that do not differ from the biologically and anthropo-logically expected patterns. The subject of how human sexuality is presented in In-ternet has been studied for decades, and the current body of knowledge was recently reviewed by Nicola (2009) for six areas: \" pornography \" , shops, work, education, contacts and subcultures. That review states that online activities related with sex are now routine for many in the Western world, with a frequency that depends on age, gender and sexual orientation. According to that author, many publications are biased toward a non-scientific, conservative approach, and little research has been conducted on the potential benefits of Internet sexuality. The very use of the term \" pornography \" rather than more rigorous terms for specific products shows a basic weakness of the academic literature on this subject that represents billions of dollars and that has extended from the old male-centered products to a large scope of products addressed to both men and women (Vera-Gamboa, 2000). The lack of scientific protocols has led to the generalized labeling of graphic sexual materials as sexist and harmful, but some academic communities conceptualize these products in terms of a dynamic nexus of actors, discourses , media economies, technologies and consumers that can only be studied within a proper cultural frame (Paasonen, 2009).

Preventive control is performed through power redispatches, involving also the on/off control of the wind generators. The quality of the approach is illustrated here through its application to the system of the Madeira island. 1 INTRODUCTION Dynamic security became nowadays a key issue in the definition of the operation strategy of any power system due to the stressed conditions that the network has to face in the present liberalized scenarios. At the same time, there is an enormous pressure to increase the integration of renewable power production in the systems, which makes dynamic security assessment more and more a crucial aspect in the definition of the operating policy to be followed. The dynamic behavior problems that may appear in the system result, in part, from the intermittent nature of some of the renewable energy sources and from its non-complete controllability. Specifically in the case of large wind power integration the problem can turn on quite critical, due to large frequency deviations that may appear. In order to deal with this issue, control centers should be able to assess, in an efficient way, dynamic security for the present and future operating conditions and, in this way, define a secure and robust operating policy. This may be achieved through the solution of the unit commitment with dynamic security restrictions regarding forecasts of load and renewable power production. It may happen, however, that the system follows a different trajectory or be subjected to changing conditions relatively to the foreseen ones, such that a given operating point may become dynamically insecure regarding to a given disturbance. In this case, preventive control measures may be suggested to the system operator, in the form of a redispatch solution.","pdfUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joao_Abel_Lopes/publication/228910080_A_general_approach_for_security_monitoring_and_preventive_control_of_networks_with_large_wind_power_production/links/00b49525f8a010bede000000.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01e8feac18ea34932f3425fbdc9ba1f1fcae05bb","title":"A General Approach for Security Monitoring and Preventive Control of Networks with Large Wind Power Production","venue":"","year":2002}

This impact can be separated into two components: (1) direct losses due to reduced production and changes in herd structure; and (2) indirect losses caused by costs of FMD control, poor access to markets and limited use of improved production technologies. This paper estimates that annual impact of FMD in terms of visible production losses and vaccination in endemic regions alone amount to between US$6.5 and 21 billion. In addition, outbreaks in FMD free countries and zones cause losses of >US$1.5 billion a year. FMD impacts are not the same throughout the world: FMD is highly contagious and the actions of one farmer affect the risk of FMD occurring on other holdings; thus sizeable externalities are generated. Control therefore requires coordination within and between countries. These externalities imply that FMD control produces a significant amount of public goods, justifying the need for national and international public investment. Equipping poor countries with the tools needed to control FMD will involve the long term development of state veterinary services that in turn will deliver wider benefits to a nation including the control of other livestock diseases.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01ef4f4bfbeb1ee95fcb53182f06d3c61ae30656","title":"The economic impacts of foot and mouth disease – What are they, how big are they and where do they occur?","venue":"Preventive veterinary medicine","year":2013}

Intraocular pressure (IOP) readings were recorded for each eye at baseline (previous therapy), 4-6 weeks, and 12 weeks after changing medical treatment to preservative-free tafluprost once-daily. We analyzed the change in IOP over the study period for all patients as well as for a subgroup of patients with prior PGA monotherapy. Subjective symptoms and objective ocular signs were determined. Comfort was measured using a 4 step scale. All adverse events were recorded. Paired t-tests were conducted to compare IOP values at baseline to IOP values after treatment with tafluprost 0.0015%. Bowker's test of symmetry was used for statistical evaluation of changes of clinical signs (hyperemia).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn total 118 patients were eligible for evaluation. In these patients with prior PGA monotherapy (n = 118) IOP decreased significantly from 16.2 ± 4.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.55) at treated baseline to 14.8 ± 3.2 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.43; P < 0.001) at final visit on tafluprost. In a subset of patients with prior latanoprost monotherapy (n = 68) mean IOP at baseline (±SD) was reduced from 16.2 ± 4.6 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.77) 14.8 ± 3.1 mm Hg at final visit (95% CI: 0.54, P < 0.001), in patients with prior travoprost monotherapy (n = 32) from 16.2 ± 4.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.05) to 14.9 ± 3.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.91; P < 0.05) and in patients with prior bimatoprost monotherapy (n = 18) from 16.4 ± 3.5 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.14) to 15.0 ± 3.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.14; P = 0.252).

Analytical expressions for the achievable spectral efficiency and average bit error rate of the proposed system over Rayleigh fading channels are derived for an arbitrary switching threshold. Numerical results are gathered to substantiate the analytical derivation showing that in terms of spectral efficiency, the system with single relay outperforms that with more than one relay at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and the optimal switching threshold can significantly improve the system performance at medium SNRs.","pdfUrls":["http://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e95-b_2_668","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vo_Nguyen_Bao/publication/220234179_Joint_Adaptive_Modulation_and_Distributed_Switch-and-Stay_for_Partial_Relay_Selection_Networks/links/0fcfd50a7c042087bc000000.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01f0e9d15f2cea94dbd7c79bb3395b4b13183a87","title":"Joint Adaptive Modulation and Distributed Switch-and-Stay for Partial Relay Selection Networks","venue":"IEICE Transactions","year":2012}

There is also a need, however, to write code that is generic across types that have no real family relationship. To satisfy this need a programming language must provide a mechanism for parametric polymorphism, allowing for types as parameters to routines and types. We show that to support modular programming and separate compilation there must be a mechanism for constraining the actual parameters of the routine or type. We describe a simple and powerful constraint mechanism and compare it with constraint mechanisms in other languages in terms of both ease of use and semantic expressiveness. We also discuss the interaction between subtype and parametric polymorphism: we discuss the subtype relations that can exist between instantiations of parameterized types, and which of those relations are useful and can be implemented efficiently. We illustrate our points using examples in Theta, a new object-oriented language, and we describe the time- and space-efficient implementation of parametric polymorphism used in Theta.","pdfUrls":["http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/papers/where-clauses.ps.gz","http://www.pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/where-clauses.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/217838.217852","http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/where-clauses.pdf","http://pmg.lcs.mit.edu/papers/where-clauses.pdf","http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/papers/where-clauses.pdf","http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/papers/where-clauses.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/01f2417606429d3e756b562d51d24802ee3a08d9","title":"Subtypes vs. Where Clauses: Constraining Parametric Polymorphism","venue":"OOPSLA","year":1995}

We consider algorithms that exploit the Level 3 BLAS where possible and place no restriction on the dimensions of A or the number of rows and columns added or deleted.

This model was applied to quantify in-canopy air-surface exchange rates and above-canopy NH(3) fluxes in a fertilized corn (Zea mays) field. Modeled air-canopy NH(3) fluxes agreed well with independent above-canopy flux estimates. Based on the model results, the urea fertilized soil surface was a consistent source of NH(3) one month following the fertilizer application, whereas the vegetation canopy was typically a net NH(3) sink with the lower portion of the canopy being a constant sink. The model results suggested that the canopy was a sink for some 70% of the estimated soil NH(3) emissions. A logical conclusion is that parametrization of within-canopy processes in air quality models are necessary to explore the impact of agricultural field level management practices on regional air quality. Moreover, there are agronomic and environmental benefits to timing liquid fertilizer applications as close to canopy closure as possible. Finally, given the large within-canopy mean NH(3) concentration gradients in such agricultural settings, a discussion about the suitability of the proposed model is also presented.","pdfUrls":["http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/4031/274842000028.pdf?sequence=1"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0200150b46909f9a7e2665b3f283c207568a5a8a","title":"Estimation of in-canopy ammonia sources and sinks in a fertilized Zea mays field.","venue":"Environmental science & technology","year":2010}

Altered coordination of sleeping and eating times may impact food-reward valuation and interoception in the brain, yet the independent and collective contributions of sleep and meal times are unknown. This randomized, in-patient crossover study experimentally manipulates sleep and meal times while preserving sleep duration (7.05±0.44 h for 5 nights). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans (2 × 5-minute runs) were obtained for four participants (three males; 25.3±4.6 years), each completing all study phases (normal sleep/normal meal; late sleep/normal meal; normal sleep/late meal; and late sleep/late meal). Normal mealtimes were 1, 5, 11 and 12.5 h after awakening; late mealtimes were 4.5, 8.5, 14.5 and 16 h after awakening. Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) was computed for a priori regions-of-interest (seeds) and contrasted across conditions. Statistically significant (P<0.05, whole-brain corrected) regionally specific effects were found for multiple seeds. The strongest effects were linked to the amygdala: increased RSFC for late versus normal mealtimes (equivalent to skipping breakfast). A main effect of sleep and interaction with meal time were also observed. Preliminary findings support the feasibility of examining the effects of sleep and meal-time misalignment, independent of sleep duration, on RSFC in regions relevant to food reward and interoception.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0200a82a273f221e3c0d5b4b7ec693a2666516ac","title":"Sleep and meal-time misalignment alters functional connectivity: a pilot resting-state study.","venue":"International journal of obesity","year":2016}

The processing of APP by gamma/epsilon-secretase activity results in the generation of the APP intracellular domain (AICD). Previously, we have shown that AICD induces the expression of genes (transgelin, alpha2-actin) with functional roles in actin organization and dynamics and demonstrated that the induction of AICD and its co-activator Fe65 (AICD/Fe65) resulted in a loss of organized filamentous actin structures within the cell. As mitochondrial function is thought to be reliant on ordered actin dynamics, we examined mitochondrial function in human SHEP neuroblastoma cells inducibly expressing AICD/Fe65. Confocal analysis of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) identified a significant decrease in the DeltaPsim in the AICD50/Fe65 over-expressing cells. This was paralleled by significantly reduced ATP levels and decreased basal superoxide production. Overexpression of the proposed AICD target gene transgelin in SHEP-SF parental cells and primary neurons was sufficient to destabilize actin filaments, depolarize DeltaPsim, and significantly alter mitochondrial distribution and morphology. Our data demonstrate that the induction of AICD/Fe65 or transgelin significantly alters actin dynamics and mitochondrial function in neuronal cells.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0203447886652236808fc8614c550c9599565ccb","title":"The amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain(AICD) disrupts actin dynamics and mitochondrial bioenergetics.","venue":"Journal of neurochemistry","year":2010}

Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) provide rich contexts for fostering scientific and mathematical thinking and reasoning. Due to being massive and persistent, the open-ended game play encourages a sustained investment in \" systems-based reasoning, model-based reasoning, [and] evaluative epistemology in which knowledge is treated as an open-ended process of evaluation and argument \" (Steinkuehler & Duncan, 2008). This reasoning is often done collaboratively (both synchronously and asynchronously) with peers. We are leveraging these affordances by developing an MMOG, The Radix Endeavor, which integrates science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) practices as core game mechanics. In this poster, we will describe how we are designing the game-play experiences around activities in biology and math content linked to the common core and next generation standards. We hope to generate discussion around the types of strategies for (1) designing collaborative problem solving activities (2) using log data to assess players at the individual and group level. Our work is guided by theories of situated and collaborative learning. From the situative perspective, learning is seen as enculturation supported by social interaction (Brown, Collins, Duguid, 1989; Lave & Wenger, 1991). Engagement and participation in activities are dependent on interaction with other people (Greeno, 1998). Many terms have been used to describe collaborative learning, such as cooperative learning We define collaborative learning as a group of students with distributed expertise sharing cognitive responsibility for a specific task or goal. The emphasis in collaborative learning is on the learning and cognitive advancement of the group. MMOGs, more than any other type of game, rely on collaboration. Not only is this a necessary so-called, \" 21st century skill; \" it is one that is particularly relevant to science as it is practiced by working scientists.

Abstract Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved amino acids (TDAA) were measured in high (Chukchi Sea) and low (Beaufort Sea) productivity regions of the Western Arctic Ocean to investigate the composition and bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Concentrations and DOC-normalized yields of TDAA in Chukchi sur-5 face waters were relatively high, indicating an accumulation of bioavailable DOM. High yields of TDAA were also observed in the upper halocline of slope and basin waters, indicating off-shelf transport of bioavailable DOM from the Chukchi Sea. In contrast, concentrations and yields of TDAA in Beaufort surface waters were relatively low, indicting DOM was of limited bioavailability. Yields of TDAA in the upper halocline of 10 slope and basin waters were also low, suggesting the Beaufort is not a major source of bioavailable DOM to slope and basin waters. In shelf waters of both systems, elevated concentrations and yields of TDAA were often observed in waters with higher chlorophyll concentrations and productivity. Surface concentrations of DOC were similar (p > 0.05) in the two systems despite the contrasting productivity, but concentra-15 tions and yields of TDAA were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in the Chukchi than in the Beaufort. Unlike bulk DOC, TDAA concentrations and yields reflect ecosystem productivity in the Western Arctic. The occurrence of elevated bioavailable DOM concentrations in the Chukchi implies an uncoupling between the biological production and utilization of DOM and has important implications for sustaining heterotrophic microbial 20 growth and diversity in oligotrophic waters of the Central Arctic basins.","pdfUrls":["http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/9/9571/2012/bgd-9-9571-2012.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/020aaad80b59ab02f3d01981f422c5bb61f6c772","title":"Dissolved organic matter composition and bioavailability","venue":"","year":2012}

We conducted entomological field surveys in the Lao PDR (Laos) and Borneo, Malaysia by surveying fleas, ticks, and lice from domestic dogs and collected additional samples from domestic cows and pigs in Laos. Rickettsia felis was detected by real-time PCR with similar overall flea infection rate in Laos (76.6%, 69/90) and Borneo (74.4%, 268/360). Both of the encountered flea vectors Ctenocephalides orientis and Ctenocephalides felis felis were infected with R. felis. The degrees of similarity of partial gltA and ompA genes with recognized species indicate the rickettsia detected in two Boophilus spp. ticks collected from a cow in Laos may be a new species. Isolation and further characterization will be necessary to specify it as a new species. Bartonella clarridgeiae was detected in 3/90 (3.3%) and 2/360 (0.6%) of examined fleas from Laos and Borneo, respectively.

BHV-1 induces apoptosis in lymphoid cells in vivo and in epithelial cell lines, but the ability of BHV-1 to induce apoptosis in sensory neurons remains unknown. In this report, the susceptibility of rabbit ganglionic neurons to infection by BHV-1 was examined in vitro and in vivo. Following infection of cultured neurons with BHV-1, hallmarks of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and membrane blebbing were detected. The appearance of these changes was preceded by active viral DNA replication as determined by in situ hybridization. When viral DNA replication was blocked by treatment of cultures with an inhibitor of eukaryotic DNA polymerases, apoptosis but not virus attachment to neurons or bICP0 gene expression was completely prevented. Taken together, these results demonstrate that sensory neurons are not intrinsically resistant to BHV-1-induced apoptosis and that viral DNA replication plays a role in triggering the apoptotic programme. Infection of rabbits with BHV-1 resulted in pathological changes in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) which included mononuclear cell infiltration and neuronophagia. Morphological evidence of apoptosis was not detected in neurons, even in cells with advanced cytophatology. Furthermore, whereas DNA fragmentation was common in infiltrating cells, it was very rare and sporadic in neurons. Therefore, mechanisms in the TG should exist to prevent neuronal apoptosis upon BHV-1 infection.","pdfUrls":["http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/83/9/2257.full.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0215a50887ea495f9025d68c1c8f2cbeb8d33ed8","title":"Susceptibility of sensory neurons to apoptosis following infection by bovine herpesvirus type 1.","venue":"The Journal of general virology","year":2002}

However, therapies based on inhibition of VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) have shown modest results for patients with cancer. Surprisingly little is known about mechanisms underlying the regulation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 expression, the main targets of these drugs. Here, analysis of tissue microarrays revealed an inversely reciprocal pattern of VEGFR regulation in the endothelium of human squamous-cell carcinomas (high VEGFR1, low VEGFR2), as compared with the endothelium of control tissues (low VEGFR1, high VEGFR2). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that VEGF signals through the Akt/ERK pathway to inhibit constitutive ubiquitination and induce rapid VEGFR1 accumulation in endothelial cells. Surprisingly, VEGFR1 is primarily localized in the nucleus of endothelial cells. In contrast, VEGF signals through the JNK/c-Jun pathway to induce endocytosis, nuclear translocation, and downregulation of VEGFR2 via ubiquitination. VEGFR1 signaling is required for endothelial-cell survival, while VEGFR2 regulates capillary tube formation. Notably, the antiangiogenic effect of bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody) requires normalization of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 levels in human squamous-cell carcinomas vascularized with human blood vessels in immunodeficient mice. Collectively, this work demonstrates that VEGF-induced angiogenesis requires inverse regulation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in tumor-associated endothelial cells.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0215fca5b3ae17f463ca4e424ff468db031734b0","title":"VEGF-dependent tumor angiogenesis requires the inverse and reciprocal regulation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2","venue":"Cell death and differentiation","year":2010}

In the first stage, formulation of generating a 2-D state-space representation that is not in the standard form of a Roesser model will be derived, while in the second stage, the desired state-space formulation to generate a 2-D Roesser state-space representation will be established based on the results obtained in the first stage by utilizing certain linear transformation. Moreover, it will be seen that the proposed formulation includes the formulation of 1-D frequency transformation for 2-D digital filters given by Koshita and Kawamata as a special case, and thus can be viewed as a natural generalization of their result. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2007.908031","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li_Xu19/publication/3343830_A_Two-Stage_Approach_to_the_Establishment_of_State-Space_Formulation_of_2-D_Frequency_Transformation/links/09e4150d1181a34925000000.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0216486fb32d64ea68818d88dc7393bb62668738","title":"A Two-Stage Approach to the Establishment of State-Space Formulation of 2-D Frequency Transformation","venue":"IEEE Signal Process.

An epidemiological study was conducted to determine reasons for this low milk production, including limited use of best management practices, such as suboptimal nutritional management.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn observational cross-sectional study of 111 SDF was performed in Nyeri County, Kenya in June of 2013 determining the effect of cow factors, farmer demographics and farm management practices on the volume of milk sold per cow per year (kg milk sold/cow). In particular, the effect of feeding high protein fodder trees and other nutritional management practices were examined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nApproximatly 38% of farmers fed fodder trees, but such feeding was not associated with volume of milk sold per cow, likely due to the low number of fodder trees per farm. Volume of milk sold per cow was positively associated with feeding dairy meal during the month prior to calving, feeding purchased hay during the past year, deworming cows every 4 or more months (as opposed to more regularly), and having dairy farming as the main source of family income. Volume of milk sold per cow was negatively associated with a household size of >5 people and feeding Napier grass at >2 meters in height during the dry season. An interaction between gender of the principal farmer and feed shortages was noted; volume of milk sold per cow was lower when female farmers experienced feed shortages whereas milk sold per cow was unaffected when male farmers experienced feed shortages.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese demographic and management risk factors should be considered by smallholder dairy farmers and their advisors when developing strategies to improve income from milk sales and animal-source food availability for the farming families.","pdfUrls":["http://www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.8/January-2015/18.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/021a014711c5bd414230ffe8ad327452196358ba","title":"Associations of farm management practices with annual milk sales on smallholder dairy farms in Kenya","venue":"Veterinary world","year":2015}

When used with film capacitors, it can increase the life of grid-interfaced power converters by eliminating limited-life electrolytic capacitors while maintaining comparable energy density. This paper introduces an enhanced version of the bipolar SSC energy buffer that achieves a higher effective energy density and round-trip efficiency, while maintaining the same bus voltage ripple ratio as the original design. Furthermore, the enhanced buffer uses fewer capacitors and switches than the original design. The enhancement in performance is achieved by modifying the control and switching patterns of the buffer switches. A prototype enhanced SSC energy buffer, designed for a 320 V bus and a 135 W load, has been built and tested. The design methodology and experimental results for the enhanced SSC energy buffer are presented and compared with the original design. The paper also presents a comparison of unipolar and bipolar SSC energy buffers. It is shown that while bipolar designs are superior in terms of effective energy density at low ripple ratios, unipolar designs can outperform bipolar designs at high ripple ratios.","pdfUrls":["http://www.rle.mit.edu/per/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Afridi-Enhanced-Bipolar-ECCE.pdf","http://www.rle.mit.edu/per/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Afridi-enhanced-bipolar.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/021e6c1d25e332578ef27d69c9811e292433bfc4","title":"Enhanced Bipolar Stacked Switched Capacitor Energy Buffers","venue":"","year":2012}

As a result, the method leads for simpler, leaner, replication-free data structures. Is also allows for an higher degree of proceduralism in generation of texture coordinates. The method is general, trivial to implement (exhaustive pseudocode is provided), very cheap on resources (with a virtually null impact on performance) and leverages only basic mechanisms widely available in most GPU implementations. An open-source implementation is made available. Recall that a \" vertex seam \" , in a polygonal mesh data structure, is a duplicated vertex with different attribute values assigned to the two (geometrically coinciding) copies of the vertex: it is used to implement a discontinuity in the values encoded as vertex attributes occurring in an geometrically C0 continuous surface. Vertex seams recur in UV-mappings used for standard texture mapping.

It is obvious that no 2 n-node Hamiltonian cycle exists in an n-dimensional faulty hypercube which has at least one faulty node. However, if a hypercube has faulty links only and the number of faulty links is at most n − 2, at least one 2 n-node Hamiltonian cycle can be found. In this paper, we propose a distributed ring-embedding algorithm that can find a Hamiltonian cycle in a fault-free or faulty n-dimensional hypercube (Q n), and the complexity is O(n) parallel steps. The algorithm is based on the recursion property of the hypercube and the free-link dimension concept. In some cases, even when the number of faulty links is larger than n − 2, Hamiltonian cycles may still exist. We will show that the largest possible number of faulty links that can be tolerated is 2 n−1 − 1. The performance and the constraints of the fault-tolerant algorithm is also analyzed in detail in this paper. Furthermore, a dynamic reconfiguration algorithm for an embedded ring is proposed and discussed. Due to the distributed nature of the algorithms, they are useful for the simulation of ring-based multiprocessors on MIMD hypercube multiprocessors.","pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/12.743414","https://www.sics.se/~sameh/research/P2P/Misc/Distributed%20Fault-Tolerant%20Ring%20Embedding%20and%20Reconfiguration%20in%20Hypercubes/t0081.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02261a456efba81414e49bfac97a315d7de8d327","title":"Distributed Fault-Tolerant Ring Embedding and Reconfiguration in Hypercubes","venue":"IEEE Trans.

It is shown that many more details of the structure examined can be distinguished in rocking curves (RC) as well as in reciprocal space maps (RSM) after application of the numerical procedure. The method proposed seems to be particularly suitable for imperfect epitaxial layers having significant lattice mismatch with respect to substrate. By means of the wavelet analysis of the X-ray images using de-noising procedure details invisible in raw pictures can be detected such as thickness fringes, gradient of lattice parameters etc., and duration of measurements can be shortened.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/022997097acca94f4eb30a971b5bcaca62682842","title":"Wavelet Shrinkage-based Noise Reduction from the High Resolution X-ray Images of Epitaxial Layers","venue":"","year":2003}

Here, we explore the diving behaviour of dytiscid beetles, a key group of surface-exchanging freshwater invertebrates, by comparing the dive responses of 25 taxa (Deronectes and Ilybius spp.) acclimated at two temperatures. The allometric slopes of dive responses in these dytiscids appear similar to those of vertebrate ectotherms, supporting the notion that metabolic mode shapes the evolution of diving performance. In both genera, beetles spend more time submerged than on the surface, and surface time does not vary with the temperature of acclimation. However, presumably in order to meet increased oxygen demand at higher temperatures, Deronectes species increase surfacing frequency, whereas Ilybius species decrease dive time, an example of 'multiple solutions.' Finally, widespread northern species appear to possess higher diving performances than their geographically restricted southern relatives, something which may have contributed to their range expansion ability.","pdfUrls":["http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Calosi_et_al_2012_diving_beetles.pdf","http://biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Calosi_et_al_2012_diving_beetles.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/022cd3594e10044d8aa66695047cc99d4bd4fdb6","title":"The comparative biology of diving in two genera of European Dytiscidae (Coleoptera).","venue":"Journal of evolutionary biology","year":2012}

The algorithm uses the structure tensor approach to determine the orientations of the edges or lines that meet at a junction and then extracts the principal orientations from a histogram of the orientation angles in a circular region around the junction. In contrast to previous solutions it uses only first-order derivatives and is suited for junctions with an arbitrary number of orientations without increasing the runtime.","pdfUrls":["http://www.lfb.rwth-aachen.de/files/publications/2006/MOL06a.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/022da9d1bf78f3e61af3df359455ed924f6fbb7a","title":"Histogram-based Orientation Analysis for Junctions Histogram-based Orientation Analysis for Junctions","venue":"","year":2006}

Towards this, the present investigation draws on a prospective study of 130 male property offenders, interviewed in the 1990s (the Oxford Recidivism Study), and followed up 10 years later.

Therefore sedation may affect diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux-related findings. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of sedation on diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux-related findings during EGD.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis retrospective study evaluated 28914 patients older than 20 years who underwent EGD at our institution between January 2011 and December 2011. Ultimately, 1546 patients indicated for EGD for health check-up and symptom evaluation were included.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 18546 patients who had diagnostic EGD: 10471 patients (56%) by non-sedated EGD and 8075 patients (43%) by sedated EGD. After statistical adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index, minimal change esophagitis, and hiatal hernia were significantly less frequently observed in the sedated EGD group [odds ratio (OR), 0.651; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.586 to 0.722 and OR, 0.699; 95% CI, 0.564 to 0.866]. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in other findings at the gastroesophageal junction, such as reflux esophagitis with Los Angeles classification A, B, C, and D or Barrett's esophagus, between the two groups. Similarly, there were no differences in early gastric cancer, advanced gastric cancer, and gastric ulcer occurrence.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSedation can impede the detection of minimal change esophagitis and hiatal hernia, but does not influence detection of reflux esophagitis of definite severity and Barrett's esophagus.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/023325746918e568a5f96a304d8e53df7c3204ef","title":"Does Sedation Affect Examination of Esophagogastric Junction during Upper Endoscopy?","venue":"Yonsei medical journal","year":2015}

novel method to model and predict the location and orientation of alpha helices in membrane-spanning proteins is presented. It is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) with an architecture that corresponds closely to the biological system. The model is cyclic with 7 types of states for helix core, helix caps on either side, loop on the cytoplasmic side, two loops for the non-cytoplasmic side, and a globular domain state in the middle of each loop. The two loop paths on the non-cytoplasmic side are used to model short and long loops separately, which corresponds biologically to the two known different membrane insertions mechanisms. The close mapping between the biological and computational states allows us to infer which parts of the model architecture are important to capture the information that encodes the membrane topology, and to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms and constraints involved. Models were estimated both by maximum likelihood and a discriminative method, and a method for reassignment of the membrane helix boundaries were developed. In a cross validated test on single sequences, our transmembrane HMM, TMHMM, correctly predicts the entire topology for 77% of the sequences in a standard dataset of 83 proteins with known topology. The same accuracy was achieved on a larger dataset of 160 proteins. These results compare favourably with existing methods.","pdfUrls":["http://people.binf.ku.dk/krogh/publications/ps/SonnhammerEtal98.pdf","http://sonnhammer.sbc.su.se/download/papers/1998_ISMB_6:175-182.pdf","http://www.cs.usu.edu/~cyan/CS6890/HMM_TMH_1998.pdf","ftp://ftp.cgb.ki.se/pub/esr/papers/1998_ISMB_6:175-182.pdf","http://www.aaai.org/Library/ISMB/1998/ismb98-021.php","http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/~mbg/clippings-u/sonnhammer-ismb-memprot.pdf","http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/krogh/papers/MembraneISMB98.ps.gz","http://www.cs.usu.edu/~cyan/CS7960/TMHMM_1.pdf","http://digital.cs.usu.edu/~cyan/CS6890/HMM_TMH_1998.pdf","http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring08/G22.2520-001/biogenomes_docs/lec3--1998_ISMB_6-175-182.pdf","http://www.aaai.org/Papers/ISMB/1998/ISMB98-021.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/023499b96536b1a0dcb04a48578c5ee2533237bc","title":"A Hidden Markov Model for Predicting Transmembrane Helices in Protein Sequences","venue":"ISMB","year":1998}

A host of important issues, including the possibility of perpetual growth or decline, depend on the precise positive value of σ. This paper examines the role of σ in the neoclassical growth model and estimates σ by combining a low-pass filter with standard panel data techniques to better measure the theoretical constructs appropriate to production function estimation. Our approach is in the spirit of Friedman's permanent income theory of consumption and Eisner's related permanent income theory of investment. While their approaches and ours are similar in relying on permanent components, we extract these components with spectral methods that are more powerful and general for identifying these unobservables. We transform the data with the Baxter-King low-pass filter that depends on two parameters, the critical periodicity defining the long-run frequencies and a window for the number of lags approximating the ideal low-pass filter. Based on an analysis of the spectrum of the transformed series, we confirm that our choices of the critical periodicity and window emphasize long-run variation. The empirical results are based on the comprehensive panel industry data constructed by Dale Jorgenson and his research associates. Our estimate of σ is 0.308 for the baseline values of the critical periodicity of eight years and window of three years. This result is robust to variations in the window. As the periodicity declines from eight to the minimum value of two, the elasticity declines owing to the distorting effects of transitory variation.","pdfUrls":["http://cep.lse.ac.uk/seminarpapers/15-12-05-CHI.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0235b3d9a3fa2980a3270d790fa9df90df7c5a75","title":"The Substitution Elasticity, Growth Theory, and the Low-pass Filter Panel Model the Substitution Elasticity, Growth Theory, and the Low-pass Filter Panel Model","venue":"","year":2005}

However, sampling variation in short-read data sets and high sequencing error rates of modern sequencers present many new computational challenges in data interpretation. These challenges have led to the development of new classes of mapping tools and de novo assemblers. These algorithms are challenged by the continued improvement in sequencing throughput. We here describe digital normalization, a single-pass computational algorithm that systematizes coverage in shotgun sequencing data sets, thereby decreasing sampling variation, discarding redundant data, and removing the majority of errors. Digital normalization substantially reduces the size of shotgun data sets and decreases the memory and time requirements for de novo sequence assembly, all without significantly impacting content of the generated contigs. We apply digital normalization to the assembly of microbial genomic data, amplified single-cell genomic data, and transcriptomic data.

This silencing of certain alleles often involves differential methylation at regulatory regions associated with imprinted genes and must be recapitulated at every generation with the erasure and reapplication of these epigenetic marks in the germline. Imprinted genes encode regulatory proteins that play key roles in fetal growth and development, but they also exert wider effects on mammalian reproduction. Genetic knockout experiments have shown that certain paternally expressed imprinted genes regulate post-natal behavior in offspring as well as reproductive behaviors in males and females. These deficits involve changes in hypothalamic function affecting multiple areas and different neurochemical pathways. Paternally expressed genes are highly expressed in the hypothalamus which regulates growth, metabolism and reproduction and so are well placed to influence all aspects of reproduction from adults to the resultant offspring. Coadaptation between offspring and mother appears to have played an important role in the evolution of some paternally expressed genes, but the influence of these genes on male reproductive behavior also suggests that they have evolved to regulate their own transmission to successive generations via the male germline.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/023af83d97887869ca826d2bb4833c63eeaa321d","title":"Genomic imprinting and mammalian reproduction.","venue":"Hormones and behavior","year":2011}

We propose a storage hierarchy, which includes a hard disk, a large low-power cache, and a docked-aware file system that lowers the average power cost of file access from the disk while retaining the storage capacity of the disk. We investigate how hoarding files in low-power memory during a power-abundant docked state can drastically reduce the power consumption of the hard disk during mobile operation. Using traced-based simulation, we determine the effects on battery run-time of adding the storage architecture to a modern palmtop device--effectively adding mass storage capability to the device. We experiment in the palmtop environment because palmtops are frequently and easily docked, and epitomize the battery and power constraints that face compact, portable devices. Our trace-based simulation shows that up to 86% of power used by the storage subsystem can be recovered using simple hoarding algorithms that cache data during the docked state.

Sentient Computing is a sensor-driven programming paradigm which maintains an event-based, dynamic model of the environment which can be used by applications in order to drive changes in their behaviour, thus achieving context-awareness. However, primitive events, especially those arising from sensors, e.g., that a user is at position (x, y, z), are too low-level to be meaningful to applications. Existing models for creating higher-level, more meaningful events, from low-level events, are insufficient to capture the user's intuition about abstract system state. Furthermore, there is a strong need for user-centred application development, without undue programming overhead. Applications need to be created dynamically and remain functional independently of the distributed nature and heterogeneity of sensor-driven systems, even while the user is mobile. Both issues combined necessitate an alternative model for developing applications in a real-time, distributed sensor-driven environment such as Sentient Computing. This dissertation describes the design and implementation of the SCAFOS framework. SCAFOS has two novel aspects. Firstly, it provides powerful tools for inferring abstract knowledge from low-level, concrete knowledge, verifying its correctness and estimating its likelihood. Such tools include Hidden Markov Models, a Bayesian Classifier, Temporal First-Order Logic, the theorem prover SPASS and the production system CLIPS. Secondly, SCAFOS provides support for simple application development through the XML-based SCALA language. By introducing the new concept of a generalised event, an abstract event, defined as a notification of changes in abstract system state, expressiveness compatible with human intuition is achieved when using SCALA. The applications that are created through SCALA are automatically integrated and operate seamlessly in the various heterogeneous components of the context-aware environment even while the user is mobile or when new entities or other applications are added or removed in SCAFOS. 3 4 To my parents Nick and Alex and my brother Dimitris, for a lifetime of love and support.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/TechReports/UCAM-CL-TR-620.pdf","http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-620.pdf","https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-620.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/023f9d72475a123ae3bfe8d9b1181b912ae6e666","title":"Middleware support for context-awareness in distributed sensor-driven systems","venue":"","year":2005}

In the laboratory at constant 24\"C, as well as in the field under natural conditions, the critical photoperiod for diapause induction is between 13:11 and 14:10 (L:D). Second instars are sensitive to diapause-inducing photoperiods, and diapause occurs in the final instar after it has emerged from the host and spun a cocoon. Study of diapausing individuals from the field during autumn and winter indicated that photoperiod has only a minor role, if any, in diapause maintenance or termination. The date of diapause termination was not deter­ mined, but the combination of diapause development and postdiapause development had not been completed in the field by the spring equinox. THE SOLITARY ENDOPARASITE Diolcogaster Jace­ tosa (Weed) is one of several braconid wasps which attack the green cloverworm, Plathypena scabra (F.), in the eastern United States (Harper et al. 1983). The green cloverworm feeds primarily on herbaceous plants, especially wild and cultivated legumes. D. Jacetosa is also known to attack larvae of four other species of Lepidoptera (Krombein et al. 1979), all of which typically feed on trees, al­ though one of them (the redbanded leafroller, Ar­ gyrotaenia velutinana (Walker)) sometimes feeds on herbaceous plants. None of these Lepidoptera appears to exceed the green cloverworm in terms of its length of seasonal availability as a potential host for the parasite. Diolcogaster Jacetosa oviposits primarily in sec­ ond and third instars of the green cloverworm. The second instar is the longest of the parasite's three instars, lasting about a week at 24°C in nondia­ pausing individuals (Yeargan & Braman 1986). A fifth-instar green cloverworm that is parasitized by D. Jacetosa leaves its host plant about 1 d before the third-instar parasite emerges. The parasite then spins a cocoon at or below the soil surface. We observed that D. Jacetosa larvae that emerged from hosts collected in the field during late summer sometimes entered diapause after they had spun cocoons. Considerable research has been directed toward overwintering capabilities and migration of the green cloverworm (e.g., Wolf et al. 1987 and ref­ erences therein), but little attention has been given to seasonal adaptations of its parasites. To under­ stand overwintering and seasonal activity of D. Jacetosa better, we studied several aspects·of dia­ pause in this parasite.

Developing countries have increasingly become involved in organic agriculture even in the absence of large domestic demands and without arrangements to get their organic foods recognized by other countries. What determines countries' involvement in organic agriculture? I argue that countries' relationship with the largest market for organic food—the European Union—in conjunction with their domestic organic regulations shapes the extent of their organic agricultural production. While investment in organic production can be risky, the risk is lower for some countries. Producers face lower risk in countries that 1) already export a lot of agricultural products to the E.U. 2) have well developed domestic regulations of organic food and 3) were former colonies of an E.U. member. Countries with these characteristics have a higher likelihood of devising a regulatory arrangement that would facilitate exports of organic products to the E.U. Accordingly, these countries have higher numbers of organic producers and higher amounts of organic agricultural land. Empirical analysis utilizing novel data compiled from annual reports on The World of Organic Agriculture supports this argument.","pdfUrls":["http://spot.colorado.edu/~moonhawk/research/Kim-GrowingOrganic.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0243d61f719385b8790791103ba1a7430ea01a82","title":"Growing Organic around the World: Domestic Regulations, International Relations and Developing Countries' Involvement in Organic Production *","venue":"","year":2013}

Homes located in more walkable neighborhoods—those with a mix of common daily shopping and social destinations within a short distance—command a price premium over otherwise similar homes in less walkable areas. Houses with the above-average levels of walkability command a premium of about $4,000 to $34,000 over houses with just average levels of walkability in the typical metropolitan areas studied. This paper explores the connection between home values and walkability, as measured by the Walk Score algorithm. Walk Score measures the number of typical consumer destinations within walking distance of a house, with scores ranging from 0 (car dependent) to 100 (most walkable). By the Walk Score measure, walkability is a direct function of how many destinations are located within a short distance (generally between one-quarter mile and one mile of a home). Our measure of walkability reflects the convenience and proximity of having shopping and cultural activities close at hand, as well as the value households attach to mixed-use neighborhoods. Using an economic technique called hedonic regression, we estimate how much market value homebuyers implicitly attach to houses with higher Walk Scores. We looked at data for more than 90,000 recent home sales in 15 different markets around the nation. Our statistical approach controlled for key characteristics of individual housing units (their size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, age and other factors), as well as for the neighborhoods in which they were located (including the neighborhood's income level, proximity to the urban center and relative accessibility to employment opportunities). After controlling for all of these other factors that are known to influence housing value, our study showed a positive correlation between walkability and housing prices in 13 of the 15 housing markets we studied. In the typical market, an additional one point increase in Walk Score was associated with between a $500 and $3,000 increase in home values. In one market (Las Vegas) there was a negative correlation—housing prices decreased with higher Walk Scores, and in one market (Bakersfield) there was no statistically significant correlation between prices and walkability after controlling for other factors.

Our tool BonnPlace incorporates a partitioning-based legalization into a force-directed loop by iteratively pulling circuits towards their positions in a legalized placement. This self-stabilizing algorithm combines the accuracy of partitioning-based methods with the stability of force-directed placement strategies. Using information from earlier iterations, it is capable of improving netlength as well as more involved objective functions like routability and timing behavior. In contrast to previous techniques, we legalize with higher effort, which allows us to reduce the number of iterations. Performance is further improved by adapting a clustering heuristic that takes into account the current cell positions, both for clustering and unclustering.

Previous research has shown that weak signals can be detected by a chaotic system. Many researchers use the Lyapunov exponent to flag the detection of a chaotic state, but our research shows that the Lyapunov exponent follows statistical characteristics, and therefore more factors should be considered in flagging chaotic weak signals. Here, we analyze the statistical characteristics inherent in the Lyapunov exponent calculation steps, and build up a statistical model for different chaotic states based on simulation data. Furthermore, we provide expressions for false-alarm and detection probabilities, selection of driving force threshold and detection of signal-noise-ratio. Finally, we summarize the method of signal amplitude estimation. Our research indicates that the performance of the detection system is related to sampling times and intervals, in accord with the theory of statistical signal detection. Citation Jin T, Zhang H.

Conclusions: We found out that the 8 patients with autoimmunity had allergy and also mixed T and B immunodeficiency. We conclude that the physicians should be aware of the correlation in chronic inflammation and the presence of the 3 immunological clinical problems to give appropriate treatment and improve the prognosis of these patients. Background: Infections caused by various microbes may induce immuno-deficiency and allergies. Methods: Tests were conducted on 579 potentially healthy people (172 women and 407 men, between 25 and 30 years), performed twice: in a diagnosis and after 6 to 12 months. Lymphocytes and NK cells from peripheral blood were assessed using cytometry. G, A, M immunoglobulin concentrations were determined by the turbidimetry. IgE concentration was measured by ELFA. HSV2, HIV and Chlamydia trachomatis infections were detected on the basis of presence of IgM and IgG antibodies tested by ELISA. For the assessment of HPV infections, DNA from the urinary-tract, squa-mous, epithelial cells were tested through PCR. The statistical analysis was undertaken using regression analyses. Results: In 579 people in the case of 65 people HPV infections were confirmed 10% men, 14.8% women. In 65 patients, in 1 case concentration of IgA was decreased, in 7 cases IgM. In 21 cases, there was higher concentration of IgE. During the cytometric analyses a decreased number of T CD31 was found in 3 cases, BCD191 in 5, TCD41 in 5, T CD81 in 4, and NK cells in 8 cases. The check for HSV2 was positive for 17 people: 1.5% men, 6.4% women. In this group, in 3 cases the concentration of IgA was decreased, in 2 cases IgM was lowered, in 4 cases there were higher concentrations of IgE. Decreased number of lymphocytes CD191 was observed for 1 person and for 1 person NK cells. Chlamydia trachomatis infections were positive in 10 cases: 1.5% men, 2.3% women, in this group 1 person had lower IgA and 2 persons had increased concentrations of IgE. HIV infection was negative for all the groups. The examination was repeated for 171 out of 579 people after 6 months.

It has been suggested that altered reinforcement and extinction processes may cause the symptoms of ADHD. The present study investigated extinction processes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), possibly the best-validated animal model of ADHD. Extinction was tested after either a variable interval (VI) or a fixed interval (FI) schedule of reinforcement with and without the presence of a conditioned reinforcer (light in the water cubicle). The results indicate a slower extinction process in the SHR compared to the normal controls, especially during the initial transition from scheduled reinforcement to extinction. Also, more responses were retained in the SHR during the later part of extinction. The extinction deficit in the SHR may be linked to reinforcer unpredictability and the presence of conditioned reinforcers, and may explain response disinhibition seen in children with ADHD.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/024ad508f00772eb379f4cef12280771a480f379","title":"Response disinhibition may be explained as an extinction deficit in an animal model of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).","venue":"Behavioural brain research","year":2004}

However, the role of aspirin on severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and the necrosis of pancreatic acinar cell are not yet clear. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of aspirin treatment on a SAP model induced by caerulein combined with Lipopolysaccharide. We found that aspirin reduced serum amylase and lipase levels, decreased the MPO activity, and alleviated the histopathological manifestations of pancreas and pancreatitis-associated lung injury. Proinflammatory cytokines were decreased and the expression of NF-κB p65 in acinar cell nuclei was suppressed after aspirin treatment. Furthermore, aspirin induced the apoptosis of acinar cells by TUNEL assay, and the expression of Bax and caspase 3 was increased and the expression of Bcl-2 was decreased. Intriguingly, the downregulation of critical necrosis associated proteins RIP1, RIP3, and p-MLKL was observed; what is more, we additionally found that aspirin reduced the COX level of pancreatic tissue. In conclusion, our data showed that aspirin could protect pancreatic acinar cell against necrosis and reduce the severity of SAP. Clinically, aspirin may potentially be a therapeutic intervention for SAP.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/024c05e63c40e7b7a502900396cb0e428a6f0b73","title":"Aspirin Protects against Acinar Cells Necrosis in Severe Acute Pancreatitis in Mice","venue":"BioMed research international","year":2016}

We challenged primary cultures of MEC from cows with heat inactivated Escherichia coli pathogens and used Affymetrix DNA-microarrays to profile challenge related alterations in their transcriptome. Compared to acute mastitis, the most prominently activated genes comprise those encoding chemokines, interleukins, beta-defensins, serum amyloid A and haptoglobin. Hence, the MEC exert sentinel as well as effector functions of innate immune defence. E. coli stimulated a larger fraction of genes (30%) in the MEC belonging to the functional category Inflammatory Response than we recorded with the same microarrays during acute mastitis in the udder (17%). This observation underscores the exquisite immune capacity of MEC. To more closely examine the adequacy of immunological regulation in MEC, we compared the inflammation dependent regulation of factors contributing to the complement system between the udder versus the MEC. In the MEC we observed only up regulation of several complement factor-encoding genes. Mastitis, in contrast, in the udder strongly down regulates such genes encoding factors contributing to both, the classical pathway of complement activation and the Membrane Attack Complex, while the expression of factors contributing to the alternative pathway may be enhanced. This functionally polarized regulation of the complex complement pathway is not reflected in the MEC models.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/59/f4/Vet_Res_2009_Mar_27_Jul-Aug_40(4)_31.tar.gz","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/59/f4/vetres-40-31.PMC2695127.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/024d7582c2590d4dfa3873aa1ab230d8933e46e1","title":"Assessment of the immune capacity of mammary epithelial cells: comparison with mammary tissue after challenge with Escherichia coli\n","venue":"Veterinary research","year":2009}

Abstract The Federal Reserve's path for withdrawal of monetary stimulus and eventually increasing interest rates could have substantial repercussions for capital flows to emerging-market economies (EMEs). This paper examines the potential impact of U.S. monetary policy normalization on portfolio flows to major EMEs by using a vector autoregressive model that explicitly accounts for market expectations of future monetary policy. The \" policy normalization shock \" is defined as a shock that increases both the yield spread of U.S. long-term bonds and monetary policy expectations while leaving the policy rate per se unchanged. Results indicate that the impact of this shock on portfolio flows as a share of GDP is expected to be economically small. The estimated impact is closely in line with that seen during the end-May to August 2013 episode in response to a comparable rise in the yield spread of U.S. long-term bonds. However, as the events during the summer of 2013 have shown, relatively small changes in portfolio flows can be associated with significant financial turmoil in EMEs. Further, there is also a strong association between the countries that are identified by our model as being the most affected and the ones that saw greater outflows of portfolio capital over May to September 2013. Résumé La voie suivie par la Réserve fédérale pour procéder à la réduction de la détente monétaire et, par la suite, à la hausse des taux d'intérêt pourrait avoir des retombées considérables sur les flux de capitaux à destination des économies émergentes. Les auteures ont recours à un modèle vectoriel autorégressif, qui prend explicitement en compte les attentes des marchés relativement à l'évolution de la politique monétaire, pour évaluer les répercussions potentielles de la normalisation de la politique monétaire américaine sur les flux d'investissements de portefeuille vers de grandes économies émergentes. Elles définissent un choc de normalisation qui ne modifie pas le taux directeur, mais a pour conséquence de creuser les écarts de taux sur les obligations à long terme des États-Unis et d'augmenter le niveau des anticipations à l'égard de …","pdfUrls":["http://macrofinance.nipfp.org.in/PDF/13Pr_Vasishtha_and_Dahlhaus.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0254154149457d3a9a8661a51b1c781d8ce13cce","title":"The Impact of U.S. Monetary Policy Normalization on Capital Flows to Emerging-Market Economies","venue":"","year":2014}

Prediction is a relatively new technique to increase instruction-level parallelism by breaking true data dependence chains. A value prediction architecture <i>produces</i> values, which may be later <i>consumed</i> by instructions that execute speculatively using the predicted value.This paper examines selective techniques for using value prediction in the presence of predictor capacity constraints and reasonable misprediction penalties. We examine prediction and confidence mechanisms in light of these constraints, and we minimize capacity conflicts through instruction filtering. The latter technique filters which instructions put values into the value prediction table. We examine filtering techniques based on instruction type, as well as giving priority to instructions belonging to the longest data dependence path in the processor's active instruction window. We apply filtering both to the producers of predicted values and the consumers. In addition, we examine the benefit of using different confidence levels for instructions using predicted values on the longest dependence path.","pdfUrls":["http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/~calder/papers/ISCA-99-SVP.pdf","http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~moshovos/ACA07/projectsuggestions/00765940.pdf","http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~kubitron/courses/cs252-F99/handouts/papers/calder_isca99.ps","http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/~calder/papers/ISCA-99-SVP.pdf","http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/calder/papers/ISCA-99-SVP.pdf","http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/calder/papers/ISCA-99-SVP.pdf","http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~calder/papers/ISCA-99-SVP.pdf","http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~moshovos/ACA07/projectsuggestions/00765940.pdf","http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/calder/papers/ISCA-99-SVP.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/300979.300985"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0258bcc9277250fe98e6eb9a0dbd7b7595250158","title":"Selective Value Prediction","venue":"ISCA","year":1999}

Cholinergic activation has been reported to inhibit all major neuron types in the MOB. In this study, the effect of diagonal band (NDB) stimulation on mitral/tufted (M/T) cell spontaneous activity was examined in anesthetized mice. NDB stimulation increased spontaneous activity in 66 MOB neurons which lasted for 2-35 s before returning to the baseline level. The majority of the effected units showed a decrease of interspike intervals (ISI) at a range of 8-25 ms. Fifty-two percent of NDB stimulation responsive units showed intrinsic rhythmical bursting, which was enhanced temporarily by NDB stimulation, whereas the remaining non-rhythmic units were capable of synchronized bursting. The effect was attenuated by scopolamine in 21 of 27 units tested. Only four NDB units were inhibited by NDB stimulation, an inhibition that lasted less than 10 s. The NDB stimulation responsive neurons appeared to be M/T cells. Our findings demonstrate an NDB excitation effect on M/T neurons that mostly requires muscarinic receptor activation, and is likely due to non-selectivity of electrical stimulation. This suggests that cholinergic and a diverse group of non-cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain co-ordinately modulate the dynamics of M/T cell spontaneous activity, which is fundamental for odor representation and attentional perception.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/c5/5d/fncir-07-00148.PMC3778317.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0258dabd29e8b9e66b396d13afd7b4403066960b","title":"The basal forebrain modulates spontaneous activity of principal cells in the main olfactory bulb of anesthetized mice","venue":"Front.

Secondary target indicators included the incidence of sleep disorders and loss of interest in sex.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThe project enrolled 79 consecutive patients with the first AMI, aged <80 years (median 61 years, 21.5% of women) with a follow-up period of 12 months. Symptoms of depression or anxiety were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory II tests (BDI-II, cut-off value ≥14) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS, cut-off ≥ 45) within 24 hours of pPCI, before the discharge, and in 3, 6 and 12 months). Results with the value p<0.05 were considered as statistically significant. The BDI-II positivity was highest within 24 hours after pPCI (21.5%) with a significant decline prior to the discharge (9.2%), but with a gradual increase in 3, 6 and 12 months (10.4%; 15.4%; 13.8% respectively). The incidence of anxiety showed a relatively similar trend: 8.9% after pPCI, and 4.5%, 10.8% and 6.2% in further follow-up.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with STEMI treated by primary PCI have relatively low overall prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety. A significant decrease in mental stress was observed before discharge from the hospital, but in a period of one year after pPCI, prevalence of both symptoms was gradually increasing, which should be given medical attention.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/d9/04/pone.0152367.PMC4830576.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/025a2309ada3935d731ee78d69f052b055c9f908","title":"Depression and Anxiety after Acute Myocardial Infarction Treated by Primary PCI","venue":"PloS one","year":2016}

Echolocation pulses emitted by the bats were recorded using a telemetry microphone mounted on the bats' backs, and their adaptation based on acoustic characteristics of emitted pulses was assessed in terms of jamming-avoidance responses (JARs). In experiment 1, frequency-modulated jamming sounds (3 ms duration) mimicking echolocation pulses of P. abramus were prepared. All bats showed significant increases in the terminal frequency of the frequency-modulated pulse by an average of 2.1-4.5 kHz when the terminal frequency of the jamming sounds was lower than the bats' own pulses. This frequency shift was not observed using jamming frequencies that overlapped with or were higher than the bats' own pulses. These findings suggest that JARs in P. abramus are sensitive to the terminal frequency of jamming pulses and that the bats' response pattern was dependent on the slight difference in stimulus frequency. In experiment 2, when bats were repeatedly exposed to a band-limited noise of 70 ms duration, the bats in flight more frequently emitted pulses during silent periods between jamming sounds, suggesting that the bats could actively change the timing of pulse emissions, even during flight, to avoid temporal overlap with jamming sounds. Our findings demonstrate that bats could adjust their vocalized frequency and emission timing during flight in response to acoustic jamming stimuli.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/025be60c3b9cd9851a53b042026cb28795f46384","title":"Adaptive changes in echolocation sounds by Pipistrellus abramus in response to artificial jamming sounds.","venue":"The Journal of experimental biology","year":2014}

We therefore investigated the activity of the degradative enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) and its binding parameters using [3H]Ro 41-1049 (defining MAO-A) and [3H]Ro 19-6327 (Lazabemide; defining MAO-B) in autopsied brain tissue from male cirrhotic patients with HE. The MAO-B parameters in HE patient tissue were not significantly different from those determined for control tissue. In contrast, increases in MAO-A activities in HE patient frontocortical (by approximately 50%) and cerebellar (by approximately 145%) tissues were observed, confirming our previous findings using comparable tissues. Increases in the abundance of the active MAO-A protein were of the same order of magnitude, e.g., in frontal cortex by approximately 85% and in cerebellum by approximately 225%. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction indicated an increase in the level of gene expression (by approximately 155%) and thus offers some of the first evidence of a transcriptional event potentially mediating MAO-A function in human brain tissue. The levels of biogenic amine acid metabolites were increased as expected.

However, how these miRNAs and their putative mRNA targets contribute to the etiology of cancer is poorly understood. In this work, a bioinformatics computational approach with miRNA and mRNA expression data was used to identify the putative targets of miRNAs and to construct association networks between miRNAs and mRNAs to gain some insights into the underlined molecular mechanisms of human colon cancer.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe miRNA and mRNA microarray expression profiles from the same tissues including 7 human colon tumor tissues and 4 normal tissues, collected by the Broad Institute, were used to identify significant associations between miRNA and mRNA. We applied the partial least square (PLS) regression method and bootstrap based statistical tests to the joint expression profiles of differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs. From this analysis, we predicted putative miRNA targets and association networks between miRNAs and mRNAs. Pathway analysis was employed to identify biological processes related to these miRNAs and their associated predicted mRNA targets.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMost significantly associated up-regulated mRNAs with a down-regulated miRNA identified by the proposed methodology were considered to be the miRNA targets. On average, approximately 16.5% and 11.0% of targets predicted by this approach were also predicted as targets by the common prediction algorithms TargetScan and miRanda, respectively. We demonstrated that our method detects more targets than a simple correlation based association. Integrative mRNA:miRNA predictive networks from our analysis were constructed with the aid of Cytoscape software. Pathway analysis validated the miRNAs through their predicted targets that may be involved in cancer-associated biological networks.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe have identified an alternative bioinformatics approach for predicting miRNA targets in human colon cancer and for reverse engineering the miRNA:mRNA network using inversely related mRNA and miRNA joint expression profiles. We demonstrated the superiority of our predictive method compared to the correlation based target prediction algorithm through a simulation study. We anticipate that the unique miRNA targets predicted by the proposed method will advance the understanding of the molecular mechanism of colon cancer and will suggest novel therapeutic targets after further experimental validations.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/6b/12/BMC_Med_Genomics_2011_May_19_4_44.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0260029d504e8ae26546a352c4ac0ef6cef66cdc","title":"Modeling microRNA-mRNA Interactions Using PLS Regression in Human Colon Cancer","venue":"BMC medical genomics","year":2011}

In this study, we investigated the possible functions of H2S in regulating Arabidopsis seed germination. NaHS treatments delayed seed germination in a dose-dependent manner and were ineffective in releasing seed dormancy. Interestingly, endogenous H2S content was enhanced in germinating seeds. This increase was correlated with higher activity of three enzymes (L-cysteine desulfhydrase, D-cysteine desulfhydrase, and β-cyanoalanine synthase) known as sources of H2S in plants. The H2S scavenger hypotaurine and the D/L cysteine desulfhydrase inhibitor propargylglycine significantly delayed seed germination. We analyzed the germinative capacity of des1 seeds mutated in Arabidopsis cytosolic L-cysteine desulfhydrase. Although the mutant seeds do not exhibit germination-evoked H2S formation, they retained similar germination capacity as the wild-type seeds. In addition, des1 seeds responded similarly to temperature and were as sensitive to ABA as wild type seeds. Taken together, these data suggest that, although its metabolism is stimulated upon seed imbibition, H2S plays, if any, a marginal role in regulating Arabidopsis seed germination under standard conditions.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02649bd65ca8b5e8b5b7a9a69a3c54a7a867b0e6","title":"The Significance of Hydrogen Sulfide for Arabidopsis Seed Germination","venue":"Frontiers in plant science","year":2016}

We focus on emulation specific features like handling of power and ground nets, unused pins as well as redundant logic and regular design structures. The efficiency of our data structures and algorithms is proved by experimental results. The main field we are working on is partitioning for multi-FPGA-systems. Many known partitioning approaches [FiMa82], [KeLi69], [BeHa96], [BeTo97] use graphs as circuit description. Unfortunately, usually just a flat graph is constructed from the netlist, loosing a lot of information which could lead to better and faster partitioning. The presented hierarchical graph model overcomes these problems and is optimized for the hierarchical partitioning algorithm presented in [BeHa96], which yields very good partitioning results by recursively working on the design hierarchy. To make the understanding of the hierarchical graph model easier, we will give some basic information on graphs at this point. Definition 3: A graph is called directed, if there is information about a source and a sink node associated with the edge, undirected otherwise. Definition 4: Two nodes connected by an edge are called adjacent nodes. Definition 5: An edge connected to a node is incident to this node. Definition 6: A netlist consists of logic elements (cells) and nets, which connect the pins of cells Definition 7: The degree (D) of a net is the number of pins connected by the net. This graph definition is sufficient for circuit description, if only nets of degree (D) two exist in the netlist. In this case, logical elements can be mapped onto nodes and nets onto edges. If there are nets with D>2, this simple model does not work anymore and there are several methods known from literature to overcome this problem. One solution is the clique-model, where each net is mapped onto several edges forming complete subgraphs. The main disadvantage of clique graphs is, that there is no possibility to check whether two edges belong to the same …","pdfUrls":["http://www.ims.uni-hannover.de/~harbich/public/paper/wdta98_web.ps.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0267432a662b2a0e07cd1d51a609aa3596e056de","title":"A New Hierarchical Graph Model for Multiple Fpga Partitioning 2 Motivation 3 Introduction","venue":"","year":1998}

As a result, MARS offers better security than triple DES while running significantly faster than single DES. The current C implementation runs at rates of about 65 Mbit/sec. on a 200 MHz Pentium-Pro, and 85 Mbit/sec. on a 200 MHz PowerPC. In hardware, MARS can achieve a 10 speedup factor. Still, both hardware and software implementations of MARS are remarkably compact, and easily fit on a smartcard and in other limited-resource environments.

Separate oxy-(HbO 2) and deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb) concentrations were assigned to locations within the mesh that corresponded to the locations of blood vessels in the detected photoacoustic image. The surrounding tissue was regarded as a homogeneous medium with optical properties that were determined by the concentrations of water, lipids, optical scatters, and HbO 2 and HHb in the capillary bed. The concentrations of the individual chromophores were the variable input parameters of the forward model.

Recordings at multiple depths in the entorhinal cortex were first used to characterize field potentials evoked by stimulation of the parasubiculum in urethan-anesthetized rats. Current source density analysis showed that a prominent surface-negative field potential component is generated by synaptic activation in layer II. The surface-negative field potential was also observed in rats with chronically implanted electrodes. The response was maintained during short stimulation trains of < or =125 Hz, suggesting that it is generated by activation of monosynaptic inputs to the entorhinal cortex. The piriform cortex also projects to layer II of the entorhinal cortex, and interactions between parasubicular and piriform cortex inputs were investigated using double-site stimulation tests. Simultaneous activation of parasubicular and piriform cortex inputs with high-intensity pulses resulted in smaller synaptic potentials than were expected on the basis of summing the individual responses, consistent with the termination of both pathways onto a common population of neurons. Paired-pulse tests were then used to assess the effect of parasubicular stimulation on responses to piriform cortex stimulation. Responses of the entorhinal cortex to piriform cortex inputs were inhibited when the parasubiculum was stimulated 5 ms earlier and were enhanced when the parasubiculum was stimulated 20-150 ms earlier. These results indicate that excitatory inputs to the entorhinal cortex from the parasubiculum may enhance the propagation of neuronal activation patterns into the hippocampal circuit by increasing the responsiveness of the entorhinal cortex to appropriately timed inputs.","pdfUrls":["http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/92/2/1226.full.pdf","http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/early/2004/03/24/jn.00038.2004.full.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02692da9046a87df51b94cf35e640d08a1ad9de2","title":"Stimulation of the parasubiculum modulates entorhinal cortex responses to piriform cortex inputs in vivo.","venue":"Journal of neurophysiology","year":2004}

The processing of sequencing data involves read alignment, variant calling, variant annotation and variant filtering. The standard file format to hold variant calls is the variant call format (VCF) file. According to the format specifications, any arbitrary annotation can be added to the VCF file for downstream processing. However, most downstream analysis programs disregard annotations already present in the VCF and re-annotate variants using the annotation provided by that particular program. This precludes investigators who have collected information on variants from literature or other sources from including these annotations in the filtering and mining of variants. We have developed VCF-Miner, a graphical user interface-based stand-alone tool, to mine variants and annotation stored in the VCF. Powered by a MongoDB database engine, VCF-Miner enables the stepwise trimming of non-relevant variants. The grouping feature implemented in VCF-Miner can be used to identify somatic variants by contrasting variants in tumor and in normal samples or to identify recessive/dominant variants in family studies. It is not limited to human data, but can also be extended to include non-diploid organisms. It also supports copy number or any other variant type supported by the VCF specification. VCF-Miner can be used on a personal computer or large institutional servers and is freely available for download from http://bioinformaticstools.mayo.edu/research/vcf-miner/.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbv051"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/026c98e2dbeb7afe04db50db62f1d431973a1340","title":"VCF-Miner: GUI-based application for mining variants and annotations stored in VCF files","venue":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","year":2016}

goal of research in artificial intelligence is to automate tasks that currently require human expertise; this automation is important because it saves time and brings problems that were previously too large to be solved into the feasible domain. Data analysis, or the ability to identify meaningful patterns and trends in large volumes of data, is an important task that falls into this category. Clustering algorithms are a particularly useful group of data analysis tools. These methods are used, for example, to analyze satellite images of the Earth to identify and categorize different land and foliage types or to analyze telescopic observations to determine what distinct types of astronomical bodies exist and to categorize each observation. However, most existing clustering methods apply general similarity techniques rather than making use of problem-specific information. This dissertation first presents a novel method for converting existing clustering algorithms into constrained clustering algorithms. The resulting methods are able to accept domain-specific information in the form of constraints on the output clusters. At the most general level, each constraint is an instance-level statement about a pair of items in the data set that indicates a preference for being placed into the same cluster, or, alternatively, into different clusters. The constrained clustering algorithms developed and presented in this dissertation enforce each constraint according to the strength of that preference. The second major contribution of this dissertation is the application of constrained clustering algorithms to diverse, significant, challenging real-world problems. We observe that the additional domain knowledge, when combined with the algorithms' ability to enforce that knowledge, produces improvements on a variety of tasks. The problem domains include automated map refinement, natural language processing, and automated data analysis of Hubble Space Telescope observations. Kiri Lou Wagstaff grew up in the small community of Castle Valley, Utah, amid the red rocks, desert sage, and wild freedom from the press of humanity. Her first computer was a Commodore Plus/4, a magical toy that utterly transformed her 11-year-old existence. After graduating from Grand County High School in 1993, Kiri spent four years in the Computer Science department at the University of Utah, earning her B.S. Along the way she developed an intense interest in artificial intelligence. The best of the AI topics, in her view, had to be machine learning-AI programs that could actually get better over time!

While the materials used so far are based on semiconductors, recent theoretical studies predict that also strongly correlated systems can show non-trivial topological properties, thereby allowing even the emergence of surface phenomena that are not possible with topological band insulators. From a practical point of view, it is also expected that strong correlations will reduce the disturbing impact of defects or impurities, and at the same increase the Fermi velocities of the topological surface states. The challenge is now to discover such correlated materials. Here, using advanced x-ray spectroscopies in combination with band structure calculations, we infer that CeRu4Sn6 is a strongly correlated material with non-trivial topology.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/59/4e/srep17937.PMC4674697.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/026e5be38d4d1081707d1c5cb644336e8cdee419","title":"CeRu4Sn6: a strongly correlated material with nontrivial topology.","venue":"Scientific reports","year":2015}

choice of actions is a fundamental problem relevant to fields as diverse as neuroscience, psychology, economics, computer science, and control engineering. Despite this broad relevance the abstract setting is similar: we have an agent choosing actions over time, an uncertain dynamical system whose state is affected by those actions, and a performance criterion that the agent seeks to optimize. Solving problems of this kind remains hard, in part, because of overly generic formulations. Here, we propose a more structured formulation that greatly simplifies the construction of optimal control laws in both discrete and continuous domains. An exhaustive search over actions is avoided and the problem becomes linear. This yields algorithms that outperform Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning, and thereby solve traditional problems more efficiently. Our framework also enables computations that were not possible before: composing optimal control laws by mixing primitives, applying deterministic methods to stochastic systems, quantifying the benefits of error tolerance, and inferring goals from behavioral data via convex optimization. Development of a general class of easily solvable problems tends to accelerate progress--as linear systems theory has done, for example. Our framework may have similar impact in fields where optimal choice of actions is relevant.","pdfUrls":["http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/papers/TodorovPNAS09.pdf","https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/papers/TodorovPNAS09.pdf","http://lazowska.cs.washington.edu/emo.pnas.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0271c9755c6569f67119a8b28193d53c0222496a","title":"Efficient computation of optimal actions.","venue":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","year":2009}

We apply a semiclassical expansion of the density of states in order to determine how the thermodynamic properties depend on the rotation frequency. The accuracy of the semiclassical approximation is tested and shown to be sufficient for describing typical experiments. At zero temperature, rotating the gas above a given frequency ΩDO leads to a 'donut'-shaped cloud which is analogous to the hole found in two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. The free expansion of the gas after suddenly turning off the trap is considered and characterized by the time and rotation frequency dependence of the aspect ratio. Temperature effects are also taken into account and both low-and high-temperature expansions are presented for the relevant thermodynamical quantities. In the high-temperature regime a virial theorem approach is used to study the delicate interplay between rotation and anharmonicity.","pdfUrls":["http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~pelster/Papers/fermigas.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/027250eebf9af0b28eadfe9003bcaf6501c835dc","title":"Rotating Fermi Gases in an Anharmonic Trap Rotating Fermi Gases in an Anharmonic Trap","venue":"","year":2009}

Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and catalase (CAT) enzymes are implicated in the prevention of DNA damage by ROS. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationships between CAT C262T, GPX1 Pro198Leu, MnSOD Ala16Val, GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphisms and the risk of CML. No association was observed between CML and variant genotypes of GPX1, MnSOD, GSTM1, and GSTT1 polymorphisms in any of the investigated cases. Our study suggests that the homozygous variant genotype of the GSTP1 Ile105Val gene polymorphisms may be associated with the risk of developing CML (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.08-5.7; P value = 0.02), while the heterozygous genotype of the CAT C262T polymorphism seems to have a protective effect against CML (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.39-0.89, P value = 0.01). In most cases, no association was found between laboratory parameters and prognostic factors and the variant genotype of investigated gene polymorphisms. We concluded that CAT, GPX, MnSOD, GSTM1, and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms are not associated with the risk of CML. Variant genotype of the GSTP1 Ile105Val gene polymorphisms may contribute to the risk of developing CML.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/027b824c2b3d4f1b113c1b43ccfcb4cb99ed0705","title":"\nCAT, GPX1, MnSOD, GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 Genetic Polymorphisms in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: A Case-Control Study","venue":"Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity","year":2014}

Smart City IoT systems refer to the things that are distributed over wide physical areas covering a whole city. While the new breed of data and resources looks promising, building applications in such large scale IoT systems is a difficult task due to the distributed and dynamic natures of entities involved, such as sensing, actuating devices, people and computing resources. In this paper, we explore the process of developing Smart City IoT applications from a coordination-based perspective. We show that a distributed coordination model that oversees such a large group of distributed components is necessary in building Smart City IoT applications. In particular, we propose Adaptive Distributed Dataflow, a novel Dataflow-based programming model that focuses on coordinating city-scale distributed systems that are highly heterogeneous and dynamic.","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3009912.3009919"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/027f1c04423f24d7469900ed196d6c3cf2e90255","title":"On Building Smart City IoT Applications: a Coordination-based Perspective","venue":"IWSC@Middleware","year":2016}

The extremely high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Swaziland complicates the management of preinvasive and invasive cervical cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the current status of cervical cytology in Swaziland, its strengths and limitations.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study is a retrospective review of 12,188 conventional cervical smears received by the Central Public Health Laboratory in Swaziland from June 2004 to May 2006.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReview of results showed very high rates of cytologic abnormalities with 43.2% of smears screened reported as abnormal. The percentages of abnormalities were as follows: atypical squamous cells of undermined significance (ASC-US), 19.8%; atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSILs (ASC-H), 8.8%; low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 9.0%; high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), 4.6%; squamous cell carcinomas, 0.5%; atypical endocervical cells, 0.6%; and atypical endometrial cells, 0.4%. Just over 5% of smears were inadequate. The highest rates of HSILs and invasive squamous carcinoma occurred in women aged 50-59 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study underscores the need to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer and its precursor lesions in Swaziland women. Based on studies of human papillomavirus (HPV) types in other Southern African countries, current HPV vaccines would reduce the incidence and mortality from cervical cancer in the future, but cervical screening would still be required, both for women already infected with the HPV and for HPV subtypes not covered by current vaccines. The most cost-effective combination of screening modalities such as visual inspection, HPV DNA testing, and cytology should be investigated. Cervical cancer reduction needs to be managed within the greater framework of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/027fded95f91258ad7ec187a1edeb4ec92fa4525","title":"The status of cervical cytology in Swaziland, Southern Africa: A descriptive study","venue":"CytoJournal","year":2009}

There is some preclinical evidence to suggest that the two are related; however, there is little information about how specific behavioral components of impulsivity are related to the acute euphorigenic effects of drugs in humans. The aim of the current study was to examine the degree to which both inattention and impulsive action predicted subjective response to amphetamine.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHealthy adults (n=165) performed the behavioral tasks and rated their subjective response to amphetamine (0, 5, 10, and 20 mg). Inattention was assessed as attention lapses on a simple reaction time task, and impulsive action was measured by stop RT on the stop task. Subjective response to amphetamine was assessed with the Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS).\n\n\nRESULTS\nHierarchical linear regression analyses showed significant negative associations between attention lapses and subjective response to amphetamine on DEQ measures. By contrast, stop RT was positively associated with responses on both DEQ and POMS measures. Additionally, a dose-response relationship was observed, such that the strength of these associations increased with higher doses of amphetamine.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest that inattention is associated with less subjective response to amphetamine. By contrast, the heightened sensitivity to stimulant drug reward observed in individuals high in impulsive action suggests that this might be one mechanism contributing to increased risk for stimulant drug abuse in these individuals.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/028299d7c8f2a9e56f8ab07966eb051106004b6d","title":"Inattention, impulsive action, and subjective response to D-amphetamine.","venue":"Drug and alcohol dependence","year":2013}

It has been debated whether a more liberal response criterion might contribute to CC. In the current experiment, participants had to search through target-absent and target-present trials to compute d-prime as the measurement of sensitivity and beta as the measurement of response bias. Results showed that participants' sensitivity was not affected by the repetition of search displays. Although repeated displays led to both faster RTs and a more liberal response criterion, these effects were uncorrelated. In the event-related potential, RT effects were reflected by a late positive activity, which reflects response-related processes, but not by differences in the N2pc as electrophysiological correlate of focused attention.

In particular , most applications need resource requirements to be satisfied simultaneously for multiple resources (such as CPU, memory and network bandwidth). Due to the inherent dynamism in many large-scale systems caused by factors such as load variations, network congestion, and churn, providing statistical guarantees on such resource requirements is important to avoid application failures and overheads. However, existing resource discovery techniques either provide statistical guarantees only for individual resources, or take a static or memoryless approach to meeting resource requirements along multiple dimensions. In this paper, we present HiDRA, a resource discovery technique providing statistical guarantees for resource requirements spanning multiple dimensions simultaneously. Our technique takes advantage of the multivariate normal distribution for the probabilistic modeling of resource capacity over multiple dimensions. Through analysis of PlanetLab traces, we show that HiDRA performs nearly as well as a fully-informed algorithm , showing better precision and having recall within 3% of such an algorithm. We have also deployed HiDRA on a 307-machine PlanetLab testbed, and our live experiments on this testbed demonstrate that HiDRA is a feasible, low-overhead approach to statistical resource discovery in a distributed system.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.umn.edu/tech_reports_upload/tr2008/08-043.pdf","https://www.cs.umn.edu/sites/cs.umn.edu/files/tech_reports/08-043.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0287461173a6d66e20534077a523f0fad8dcdf8c","title":"Hidra: Statistical Multi-dimensional Resource Discovery for Large-scale Systems Hidra: Statistical Multi-dimensional Resource Discovery for Large-scale Systems Hidra: Statistical Multi-dimensional Resource Discovery for Large-scale Systems","venue":"","year":2008}

Extensive field studies across a latitudinal temperature gradient highlight detrimental effects of rising temperatures on its growth, demography, and skeletal characteristics, suggesting that depression of photosynthesis at high temperatures might cause these negative effects. Here we test this hypothesis by analyzing, by means of pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry, the photosynthetic efficiency of B. europaea specimens exposed in aquaria to the annual range of temperatures experienced in the field (13, 18, and 28°C), and two extreme temperatures expected for 2100 as a consequence of global warming (29 and 32°C). The indicators of photosynthetic performance analyzed (maximum and effective quantum yield) showed that maximum efficiency was reached at 20.0-21.6°C, slightly higher than the annual mean temperature in the field (18°C). Photosynthetic efficiency decreased from 20.0 to 13°C and even more strongly from 21.6 to 32°C. An unusual form of bleaching was observed, with a maximum zooxanthellae density at 18°C that strongly decreased from 18 to 32°C. Chlorophyll a concentration per zooxanthellae cell showed an opposite trend as it was minimal at 18°C and increased from 18 to 32°C. Since the areal chlorophyll concentration is the product of the zooxanthellae density and its cellular content, these trends resulted in a homogeneous chlorophyll concentration per coral surface across temperature treatments. This confirms that B. europaea photosynthesis is progressively depressed at temperatures >21.6°C, supporting previous hypotheses raised by the studies on growth and demography of this species. This study also confirms the threats posed to this species by the ongoing seawater warming.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/99/46/fphys-06-00317.PMC4631832.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0287adeed7728b02b09cf4e7e50c976aad512c7d","title":"Negative response of photosynthesis to natural and projected high seawater temperatures estimated by pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry in a temperate coral","venue":"Front.

We tested the hypothesis that frustration adversely impacts attention and behavior in children with bipolar disorder (BPD).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirty-five children with BPD and 26 normal control subjects completed: 1) a Posner attention task with feedback but no contingencies; 2) an affective Posner with contingencies; and 3) an affective Posner that used rigged feedback to induce frustration. Reaction time (RT) and event-related potential (ERP) data were collected.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt baseline (task 1), there were no between-group differences in behavior or ERPs. Children with BPD exhibited reduced parietal P3 amplitude on task 3 only. On trials occurring after negative feedback, control subjects showed decreased RT when contingencies were introduced (task 2), whereas BPD subjects did not.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe introduction of contingencies was associated with impaired performance of children with BPD, suggesting deficits in their ability to adapt to changing contingencies. In addition, frustration was associated with disrupted attention allocation in children with BPD. We hypothesize that children with BPD inappropriately deployed attention to their internal frustration rather than to the task, causing impaired performance.","pdfUrls":["http://www.education.umd.edu/HDQM/labs/Fox/publications/47.pdf","http://catlab.la.psu.edu/publications/pubs/Pediatric%20bipolar%20disorder.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/028dc95a12856fa60d1895156a48ba46328f30c4","title":"The impact of reward, punishment, and frustration on attention in pediatric bipolar disorder.","venue":"Biological psychiatry","year":2005}

In this paper we are tying on this problem introducing a measure called statistic complexity.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nThis complexity measure is different to all other measures in the following senses. First, it is a bivariate measure that compares two objects, corresponding to pattern generating processes, on the basis of the normalized compression distance with each other. Second, it provides the quantification of an error that could have been encountered by comparing samples of finite size from the underlying processes. Hence, the statistic complexity provides a statistical quantification of the statement ' is similarly complex as Y'.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe presented approach, ultimately, transforms the classic problem of assessing the complexity of an object into the realm of statistics. This may open a wider applicability of this complexity measure to diverse application areas.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/d9/4d/PLoS_One_2010_Aug_26_5(8)_e12256.tar.gz","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/d9/4d/pone.0012256.PMC2928735.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02924f2a0f2b27170effd6f6829f0802e793d475","title":"Statistic Complexity: Combining Kolmogorov Complexity with an Ensemble Approach","venue":"PloS one","year":2010}

With appropriate parameter choices, the estimate is the solution to a sparse, diagonally dominant linear system, solvable in near-linear time. Our analysis shows how the risk varies with the sparsity and regulariza-tion level, thus establishing a statistical estimation setting for which there is an explicit, smooth tradeoff between risk and computation.

The algorithm is motivated by genetic algorithms which update a population of solutions rather than just a single representative as is typical for gradient descent. This modification of traditional gradient descent (as used for example in the backpropagation algorithm) avoids getting trapped in local minima. We use an averaging analysis of the algorithm to relate its behaviour to an associated ordinary differential equation. We derive a result concerning how long one has to wait in order that with a given high probability, the algorithm is within a certain neighborhood of the global minimum, We also analyze the effect of different population sizes. An example is presented which corroborates our theory very well.","pdfUrls":["http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Iven_Mareels/publication/221497573_Online_Learning_via_Congregational_Gradient_Descent/links/0fcfd50ced2814d8f0000000.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01211551","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/225298.225330","http://axiom.anu.edu.au/~williams/papers/P63.pdf","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Iven_Mareels/publication/221497573_Online_Learning_via_Congregational_Gradient_Descent/links/0fcfd50ced2814d8f0000000.pdf","http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~williams/papers/P63.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/029af21f644249697ef822d32a06683dcbaafc06","title":"Online Learning via Congregational Gradient Descent","venue":"COLT","year":1995}

Mutations in the SPAST (previously known as SPG4) gene that encodes the microtubule-severing protein called spastin, are the most common cause of the disease. The aetiology of the disease is poorly understood, but partial loss of microtubule-severing activity resulting from inactivating mutations in one SPAST allele is the most postulated explanation. Microtubule severing is important for regulating various aspects of the microtubule array, including microtubule number, length, and mobility. In addition, higher numbers of dynamic plus-ends of microtubules, resulting from microtubule-severing events, may play a role in endosomal tubulation and fission. Even so, there is growing evidence that decreased severing of microtubules does not fully explain HSP-SPG4. The presence of two translation initiation codons in SPAST allows synthesis of two spastin isoforms: a full-length isoform called M1 and a slightly shorter isoform called M87. M87 is more abundant in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. Studies on rodents suggest that M1 is only readily detected in adult spinal cord, which is where nerve degeneration mainly occurs in humans with HSP-SPG4. M1, due to its hydrophobic N-terminal domain not shared by M87, may insert into endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and together with reticulons, atlastin and REEP1, may play a role in the morphogenesis of this organelle. Some mutated spastins may act in dominant-negative fashion to lower microtubule-severing activity, but others have detrimental effects on neurons without further lowering microtubule severing. The observed adverse effects on microtubule dynamics, axonal transport, endoplasmic reticulum, and endosomal trafficking are likely caused not only by diminished severing of microtubules, but also by neurotoxicity of mutant spastin proteins, chiefly M1. Some large deletions in SPAST might also affect the function of adjacent genes, further complicating the aetiology of the disease.","pdfUrls":["http://neurobio.drexelmed.edu/baasweb/PDFs2011/Hereditary%20spastic%20paraplegia%20SPG4-%20what%20is%20known%20and%20not%20known%20about%20the%20disease.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/029c1378738f7b9fb47a150bc6b8e5e3e75331c5","title":"Hereditary spastic paraplegia SPG4: what is known and not known about the disease.","venue":"Brain : a journal of neurology","year":2015}

This future Arctic is likely to have dramatically less permanent ice than exists at present. At the present rate of change, a summer ice-free Arctic Ocean within a century is a real possibility, a state not witnessed for at least a million years. The change appears to be driven largely by feedback-enhanced global climate warming, and there seem to be few, if any, processes or feedbacks within the Arctic system that are capable of altering the trajec-tory toward this \" super interglacial \" state. For nearly 30 years, Arctic sea ice extent [e.g., Stroeve et al., 2005] and thickness [Rothrock et al., 2003] have been falling dramatically (Figure 1). Permafrost temperatures are rising and coverage is decreasing [Osterkamp and Romanovsky, 1999]. Mountain glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet are shrinking [Meier et al., 2003; Box et al., 2004]. Evidence suggests we are witnessing the early stage of an anthropogenically induced global warming superimposed on natural cycles [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2001], reinforced by reductions in Arctic ice. Despite 30 years of warming and ice loss, the Arctic cryosphere is still within the envelope of glacial-interglacial cycles that have characterized the past 800,000 years. However, although the Arctic is still not as warm as it was during the Eemian interglacial 125,000 years ago [e.g., Andersen et al., 2004], the present rate of sea ice loss will likely push the system out of this natural envelope within a century. Climate models corroborate this projection with depictions of sea-ice-free summers within the same time frame [Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, 2005]. There is no paleoclimatic evidence for a seasonally ice free Arctic during the last 800 millennia. A major deglaciation of Greenland would take many centuries at present rates [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2001], but destabilizing mechanisms such as basal sliding could accelerate the pace [Zwally et al., 2002]. The third perennial ice type—permafrost—is diffi cult to observe, and thus little is known about its past state. Recent surveys indicate, however, that it too is warming and thawing in some areas [Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, 2005]. In a recent synthesis by the authors, it was found that the fundamental Arctic system could be understood by links among nine key components, or hubs.

The design cycle of a new implicit surface is, therefore, fraught with long latency times as a user must wait for the surface to be rendered before being able to decide what changes should be introduced in the next iteration. In this paper, we present an attempt at reducing the design cycle of an implicit surface modeler by introducing a progressive refinement rendering approach to the visualisation of implicit surfaces. This progressive refinement renderer provides a quick previewing facility. It first displays a low quality estimate of what the final rendering is going to be and, as the computation progresses, increases the quality of this estimate at a steady rate. The progressive refinement algorithm is based on the adaptive subdivision of the viewing frus-trum into progressively smaller cells. An estimate for the average value and the variance of the implicit function inside each cell is obtained with an affine arithmetic range estimation technique. Overall, we show that our progressive refinement approach not only provides the user with visual feedback as the rendering advances but is also capable of completing the image faster than a conventional implicit surface rendering algorithm based on ray casting.","pdfUrls":["http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~mag/papers/CS0511.pdf","http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/S.Maddock/research/gamito/papers/CS0511.pdf","http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/S.Maddock/publications/GamitoMaddock2005_CS0511.pdf","http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~mag/papers/progressivegrapp.pdf","http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~mag/papers/progressivespringer.pdf","http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/S.Maddock/research/gamito/papers/progressivespringer.pdf","http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/S.Maddock/research/gamito/papers/progressivegrapp.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/029fb7eb5906504e3372413e604b4c2cd551aa93","title":"A progressive refinement approach for the visualisation of implicit surfaces","venue":"GRAPP","year":2006}

In this paper, a framework is proposed that employs KWS to enhance the efficiency in the manual transcription process, thus, reducing drastically the cost of training data creation. The core principle relies upon the ability of robust document-specific descriptors to produce meaningful similarities between a chosen word image for transcription and the corresponding word images in the full dataset under consideration. In the proposed framework, KWS is coupled with a relevance feedback mechanism which further enhances retrieval performance while being independent to the chosen KWS algorithm.

Verification is carried out by the SMV model checker program [McM92]. SMV requires specifications to be written in the temporal logic CTL (computation tree logic). SMV's model checking algorithm carries out inference over CTL formulas, with respect to a formal representation of a circuit. The system can turn English sentences into CTL formulas, allowing natural language specifications to be used. A parser for English, returning general-purpose semantic representations, is allied with a convertor from these representations to CTL. The convertor is integrated with the SMV model checker, so that inferential information may be used during semantic interpretation. The result exemplifies an interesting class of natural language understanding systems where the target is a specialised reasoning engine (as opposed, say, to a database). The semantic interpretation process exploits this engine, and the application as a whole delivers increased access to a significant industrial technique. Mechanised formal specification and verification tools can significantly aid system design in both software and hardware. One established approach to verification is temporal model checking, which allows the designer to check that certain desired properties hold of the system.

This paper presents a document image binarization technique that segments the text from badly degraded document images accurately. The proposed technique is based on the observations that the text documents usually have a document background of the uniform color and texture and the document text within it has a different intensity level compared with the surrounding document background. Given a document image the proposed technique first estimates a document background surface through an iterative polynomial smoothing procedure. Different types of document degradation are then compensated by using the estimated document background surface. The text stroke edge is further detected from the compensated document image by using L1-norm image gradient. Finally, the document text is segmented by a local threshold that is estimated based on the detected text stroke edges. The proposed technique was submitted to the recent Document Image Binarization Contest (DIBCO) held under the framework of IC-DAR 2009 and has achieved the top performance among 43 algorithms that are submitted from 35 international research groups.","pdfUrls":["http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~subolan/files/IJDAR_revision.pdf","http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tancl/publications/j2010/IJDAR.pdf","http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tancl/Papers/IJDAR/IJDAR.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10032-010-0130-8"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02a59823aa1a2983cc39f04cc33f44515879afac","title":"Document image binarization using background estimation and stroke edges","venue":"IJDAR","year":2010}

It is interesting, nevertheless, to change this perspective addressing the following question: what should we do to create a universe, in a laboratory? It appears, in fact, that this is, in principle, possible according to at least two different paradigms; both allow to circumvent singularity theorems, i.e. the necessity of singularities in the past of inflating domains which have the required properties to generate a universe similar to ours. The first of them is substantially classical, and is built up considering solitons which collide with surrounding topological defects, generating an inflationary domain of space-time. The second is, instead, partly quantum and considers the possibility of tunnelling of past-non-singular regions of spacetime into an inflating universe, following a well-known instanton proposal. We are, here, going to review some of these models, as well as highlight possible extensions, generalizations and the open issues (as for instance the detectability of child universes and the properties of quantum tunnelling processes) that still affect the description of their dynamics. In doing so we will remark how the works on this subject can represent virtual laboratories to test the role that fundamental principles of physics (particularly, the interplay of quantum and general relativistic realms) played in the formation of our universe. 1 State of the Art of Universe Creation in the Laboratory Cosmology is usually considered as an observational discipline, not susceptible of a direct experimental approach. This seems, of course, quite intrinsic to the discipline itself, which deals with problems related to the birth of our universe and its evolution in the present state; in fact the very meaning of the word 1 cosmology (stemming from the Greek word cosmos, which meant beauty, harmony) seems to bind us to a passive, contemplative attitude in the study of the universe. On the other hand, even without considering phenomena proper of the quantum world, already General Relativity, a classical theory, brings a challenge to the above perspective, by raising for the first time the concept of causality as a central one in physics. Because of causal relationships, the domain of what can be experienced/observed might be, or more likely is, only a subset of what is existing. At the same time the very concept of causality and its relationship with the global spacetime structure brings up another problem in the scenario of cosmology.

On the one hand, Java's advanced features, e.g. calls of virtual methods, need to be optimized with appropriate inter-class techniques. Additionally, Java's memory management requires fast garbage collection observing real-time deadlines. On the other hand, new hardware trends create problems: heterogeneous parallel embedded systems require new techniques for performance optimization, and cache storage needs to be allocated by the compiler in order to exploit the speed of new processors. To meet these requirements, the EU long-term research project JOSES (Java and CoSy technology for Embedded Systems) has been initiated. Its mission is to create a Java-based European technology for heterogeneous embedded systems, including an optimizing Java compiler environment producing high-performance native code. JOSES will exploit the European product-quality compiler framework CoSy, marketed by ACE. This component-based technology allows re-use of existing compiler engines and employs generator technology wherever possible.","pdfUrls":["http://www.pds.ewi.tudelft.nl/pubs/papers/emmsec99.pdf","http://www.info.uni-karlsruhe.de/~assmann/reports/assmann-genius-emmsec99.ps.gz","http://www.pds.its.tudelft.nl/pubs/papers/emmsec99.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02ab2cbe58292438bd184530539ddc7a1c68eb68","title":"Java and Cosy Technology for Embedded Systems: the Joses Project","venue":"","year":1999}

The effects of social participation, social ties, marital status, and emotional support on hypertension, obesity, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen were estimated by logistic regression controlling for age, sex, education, physical function, depression, cardiovascular disease, other chronic diseases, physical activity, and smoking.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSocial participation is a consistent predictor of low risk for four risk factors, even after controlling for a wide range of covariates. Being married is associated with lower risk for hypertension. Social ties and emotional support are not significantly associated with any of the cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur analysis suggests that participation in social activities has a stronger association with CV risk factors than marital status, social ties or emotional support.

BACKGROUND People are explanatory creatures with a tendency to seek understanding: to form explanations and interpretations of their experiences. In particular, this is true for experiences of emotions. In order to make sense of 1 emotional events and situations – whether directly perceived/experienced or presented in a story, in a film, and so on – human beings do – and necessarily so – make use of some kind of conceptions – ideas, beliefs, 'theories'. 2 For instance: • In order to predict that a person who displays intense anger towards someone will thereafter feel less angry, one relies on a belief that anger goes away if one expresses it. • In order to interpret someone's reaction as 'I had the feeling that he was, nevertheless, very depressed, although I could not tell by looking at him', one uses a conception of a distinction and yet a relation between internal, felt emotion on the one hand and displayed emotion on the other. • In explaining why a person has been frequently ill during the past few weeks, by referring to the fact that the person's best 1 Interpret, reason about, explain, predict, etc. 2 Compare Harris' (1989) research on conceptions of emotions from a developmental–psychological perspective. Harris argues that the interpretations and ways of reasoning of young children, when they are making predictions or are explaning emotional situations, indicate that they are not just detecting empirical associations between situations and responses, but that they are making use of conceptions or theories, in the sense of 'structures of unobservable 'entities' used to explain and predict certain observable events'. friend has moved away far away, one relies on an idea of sadness as something that can cause physical illness. • In order to view a situation such as that 'my anger suddenly struck me without me understanding it' or such as that 'my sadness just keeps growing', one uses an idea of sadness as something that has a kind of agent-status, i.e., that it exists and 'does things' independently, to some extent, of oneself. Such conceptions are often 'unconscious' or 'not immediately accessible to verbalization', as they are, to some extent, what one perceives with – not what one perceives.

This clone recognized all melanoma cell lines tested and, to a lower extent, melanocytes, in the context of human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen A2 (HLA-A2), but it did not recognize other tumor cell types. The gene coding for the antigen recognized by this clone was identified by the screening of a melanoma complementary DNA expression library. This antigen is overexpressed in melanomas, compared with other cancer cell lines and healthy tissues, and was thus called melanoma-overexpressed antigen (meloe). Remarkably, the structure of meloe was unusual, with multiple short open reading frames (ORFs). The peptide recognized by the CTL clone was encoded by one of these ORFs, called MELOE-1. Using a specific HLA-A2/peptide tetramer, we showed a correlation between the infusion of TILs containing MELOE-1-specific T cells and relapse prevention in HLA-A2 patients. Indeed, 5 out of 9 patients who did not relapse were infused with TILs that contained MELOE-1-specific T cells, whereas 0 out of the 21 patients who relapsed was infused with such TIL-containing lymphocytes. Overall, our results suggest that this new antigen is involved in immunosurveillance and, thus, represents an attractive target for immunotherapy protocols of melanoma.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/6f/f1/J_Exp_Med_2008_Oct_27_205(11)_2673-2682.tar.gz","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/6f/f1/jem2052673.PMC2571940.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02ad033b9c3a05f114242a44625e72944714da4b","title":"MELOE-1 is a new antigen overexpressed in melanomas and involved in adoptive T cell transfer efficiency","venue":"The Journal of experimental medicine","year":2008}

In Wise-/- mutant mice we find an increase in the rate of osteoblast proliferation and a transient increase in bone mineral density. This change in proliferation is dependent upon Lrp5, as Wise;Lrp5 double mutants have normal bone mass. This suggests that Wise serves as a negative modulator of Wnt signaling in active osteoblasts. Wise and the closely related protein Sclerostin (Sost) are expressed in osteoblast cells during temporally distinct early and late phases in a manner consistent with the temporal onset of their respective increased bone density phenotypes. These data suggest that Wise and Sost may have common roles in regulating bone development through their ability to control the balance of Wnt signaling. We find that Wise is also required to potentiate proliferation in chondrocytes, serving as a potential positive modulator of Wnt activity. Our analyses demonstrate that Wise plays a key role in processes that control the number of osteoblasts and chondrocytes during bone homeostasis and provide important insight into mechanisms regulating the Wnt pathway during skeletal development.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/6c/a2/pone.0096257.PMC4006890.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02b1b483e7ece65cd1eddc7afb97c99e1daffcb0","title":"Wise Regulates Bone Deposition through Genetic Interactions with Lrp5","venue":"PloS one","year":2014}

Across the experimental period, the mean total soil respiration and litter respiration were 1.94 and 0.81, 2.00 and 0.60, 2.19 and 0.71 µmol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), and the litter dry mass remaining was 57.6%, 56.2% and 61.3% in the 20-, 30-, and 46-year-old forests, respectively. We found that the temporal variations of soil respiration and litter decomposition rates can be well explained by soil temperature at 5 cm depth. Both the total soil respiration and litter respiration were significantly positively correlated with the litter decomposition rates. The mean contribution of the litter respiration to the total soil respiration was 31.0%-45.9% for the three different-aged forests. The present study found that the total soil respiration was not significantly affected by forest age when P. masonniana stands exceed a certain age (e.g. >20 years old), but it increased significantly with increased soil temperature. Hence, forest management strategies need to protect the understory vegetation to limit soil warming, in order to reduce the CO2 emission under the currently rapid global warming. The contribution of litter decomposition to the total soil respiration varies across spatial and temporal scales. This indicates the need for separate consideration of soil and litter respiration when assessing the climate impacts on forest carbon cycling.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02b326928e540285ed39c52cd4e5f3a6144a9d50","title":"Rates of Litter Decomposition and Soil Respiration in Relation to Soil Temperature and Water in Different-Aged Pinus massoniana Forests in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China","venue":"PloS one","year":2014}

Small film samples are particularly susceptible to film curling which may be undetected or deemed insignificant. In this study, we consider test cases with controlled induced curvature of film and with film raised horizontally above the scanner plate. We also evaluate the difference in scans of a film irradiated with a typical brachytherapy dose distribution with the film naturally curved and with the film held flat on the scanner. Typical naturally occurring curvature of film at scanning, giving rise to a maximum height 1 to 2 mm above the scan plane, may introduce dose errors of 1% to 4%, and considerably reduce gamma evaluation passing rates when comparing film-measured doses with treatment planning system-calculated dose distributions, a common application of film dosimetry in radiotherapy. The use of a triple-channel dosimetry algorithm appeared to mitigate the error due to film curvature compared to conventional single-channel film dosimetry. The change in pixel value and calibrated reported dose with film curling or height above the scanner plate may be due to variations in illumination characteristics, optical disturbances, or a Callier-type effect. There is a clear requirement for physically flat films at scanning to avoid the introduction of a substantial error source in film dosimetry. Particularly for small film samples, a compression glass plate above the film is recommended to ensure flat-film scanning.

We constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) for diabetes using risk variants identified from the GWAS catalog (http://genome.gov/gwastudies) that were associated with T2D risk at a minimum significance level of P ≤ 5.0E-8 among Asian population and evaluated its associations with BC outcomes with Cox proportional hazards models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring a median follow-up of 8.08 years (range, 0.01-16.95 years), 1208 deaths were documented in 6346 BC patients. Overall, the diabetes GRS was not associated with OS and DFS. Analyses stratified by estrogen receptor status (ER) showed that the diabetes GRS was inversely associated with OS among women with ER- but not in women with ER+ breast cancer; the multivariable adjusted HR was 1.38 (95% CI: 1.05-1.82) when comparing the highest to the lowest GRS quartiles. The association of diabetes GRS with OS varied by diabetes status (P for interaction <0.01). In women with history of diabetes, higher diabetes GRS was significantly associated with worse OS, with HR of 2.22 (95% CI: 1.28-3.88) for the highest vs. lowest quartile, particularly among women with an ER- breast cancer, with corresponding HR being 4.59 (95% CI: 1.04-20.28). No significant association between the diabetes GRS and OS was observed across different BMI and PR groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study suggested that genetic susceptibility of T2D was positively associated with total mortality among women with ER- breast cancer, particularly among subjects with a history of diabetes. Additional studies are warranted to verify the associations and elucidate the underlying biological mechanism.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02ba8383141ad386717f756f130353dc2a1fd27d","title":"Association of Type 2 Diabetes Genetic Variants with Breast Cancer Survival among Chinese Women","venue":"PloS one","year":2015}

These facts are even true in the regression context for unbounded output spaces, if the target function f is integrable with respect to the marginal distribution of the input variable X and if the output variable Y has a finite first absolute moment. The latter assumption clearly excludes distributions with heavy tails, e.g., several stable distributions or some extreme value distributions which occur in financial or insurance projects. The main point of this paper is that we can enlarge the applicability of SVMs even to heavy-tailed distributions, which violate this moment condition.

We then assessed whether empirically derived reinforcers and punishers could be combined to treat the destructive behaviors of two clients. For both clients, the rates of destructive behavior decreased markedly.

A. For Projects up to $4 Million: The unit price may be up to five percent of the total project, but cannot exceed $120,000. B. For Projects Over $4 Million: The unit price may be up to three percent of the total project, but cannot exceed $600,000. Implementation of this recommendation only places a limit on one pay item and does not direct the industry in how to do their business. This limit will be set by unique pay item for each proposal, giving MDOT the ability to follow this policy while still allowing for special projects that may require new or unique equipment, material, leases or other costly items. It will benefit MDOT by taking Mobilization out of the \"Life Cycle Cost Analysis\" part of any project by moving the actual cost of work to be incorporated into those pay items that actually pay for the work. This will help assure that we will have truer results when we cost analyze different approaches to providing the desired facility. It will still provide the contractor with the legitimate needed mobilization money while not giving the appearance of a large cash handout when no work has been performed. The limit is accurate and serves the desired purpose without being complicated enough to cause contractual conflicts or difficulties. ACTION: The EOC approved the recommendation and requested the Design Division to send it to the Michigan Road Builders Association for their review and comment. Bob Welke requested that the lane mileage accounting process be reviewed and updated to ensure more accurate numbers and that a realistic picture is being provided. Every year we are adding new lane miles to our system, which has a cascading effect on maintenance budgets. There are three or four different ways being used in the department to count this mileage, and they are not always compatible. A common database is highly desirable, but we need to know what measurement methods are being used now and what the effect would be on divisions/districts if we switched to lane miles, including ramps, center turn lanes, and passing flares.

This paper studies the NP-complete problem of edge matching puzzles focusing on providing generation models of problem instances of variable hardness and on its resolution through the application of SAT and CSP techniques. From the generation side, we also identify the phase transition phenomena for each model. As solving methods, we employ both; SAT solvers through the translation to a SAT formula, and two ad-hoc CSP solvers we have developed, with different levels of consistency, employing several generic and specialized heuristics. Finally, we conducted an extensive experimental investigation to identify the hardest generation models and the best performing solving techniques.","pdfUrls":["http://repositori.udl.cat/bitstream/handle/10459.1/46646/013066.pdf?sequence=1"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02c7d623a9896faec6459a17131f7f3f03454657","title":"Edge Matching Puzzles as Hard Sat/csp Benchmarks (extended Version)","venue":"","year":2013}

The study aimed to test whether activity levels can be increased by the provision of monitored activity data to patients and clinicians in the context of explicit goal setting.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized controlled trial in three sites in Australia included 255 inpatients aged 60 and older who had a rehabilitation goal to become ambulant. The primary outcome was patients' walking time measured by accelerometers during the rehabilitation admission. Walking times from accelerometry were made available daily to treating therapists and intervention participants to motivate patients to improve incidental activity levels and reach set goals. For the control group, 'usual care' was followed, including the setting of mobility goals; however, for this group, neither staff nor patients received data on walking times to aid the setting of daily walking time targets.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe median daily walking time in the intervention group increased from 10.3 minutes at baseline to 32.1 minutes at day 28, compared with an increase from 9.5 to 26.5 minutes per day in the control group. Subjects in the intervention group had significantly higher non-therapy walking time by about 7 minutes [mean (95% CI): 24.6 (21.7, 27.4)] compared to those in the control group [mean(95% CI): 17.3 (14.4, 20.3)] (p = 0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDaily feedback to patients and therapists using an accelerometer increased walking times during rehabilitation admissions. The results of this study suggest objective monitoring of activity levels could provide clinicians with information on clinically important, mobility-related activities to assist goal setting.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12611000034932 http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02ca5585245bfb917a8d45149134dda699862818","title":"Promoting Activity in Geriatric Rehabilitation: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Accelerometry","venue":"PloS one","year":2016}

The source counts reach a density of ∼ 1000 deg −2 at a limiting flux of ∼ 10 −15 erg cm −2 s −1. At this level 70–80% of the 0.5–2 keV X–ray background is resolved into discrete sources. Because of the excellent HRI positions, 83 X–ray sources with fluxes (0.5–2 keV) above 1.2 × 10 −15 erg cm −2 s −1 could be optically identified so far utilizing deep optical CCD images, NIR photometry and Keck spectroscopy. Only 11 sources above this flux limit remain unidentified. The majority of objects turned out to be active galactic nuclei (AGN) with minority contributions of clusters of galaxies, stars and some individual galaxies. These deep pencil beam data together with a number of shallower ROSAT surveys define the source counts over six orders of magnitude in flux and provide a unique tool of unprecedented quality to study the cosmological evolution of AGN, which can easily provide the bulk of the extra-galactic X–ray background and could give an important contribution to the total background light in the universe.","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9901103v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9901103v2.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02d1c00a6d5ec0bc7ca5129c4e959340ea1417ef","title":"The Rosat Deep Surveys","venue":"","year":1999}

Nine years after his primary diagnosis, the patient suffered from severe neck pain. MRI demonstrated a large demarcated mass adjacent to the right atlas. The right vertebral artery (VA), completely engulfed by the tumor, showed a narrowing and ended in the PICA. Poor collateral blood supply in the right PICA territory was presumed. To prevent ischemic complications, an OA-PICA bypass was performed prior to the tumor resection.

Locomotor performance, activation patterns of the soleus (Sol), medial gastrocnemius (MG), vastus lateralis (VL), and tibialis anterior (TA) and MG tendon force during quadrupedal stepping were studied in adult Rhesus before and after 14 days of either spaceflight (n = 2) or flight simulation at 1G (n = 3). Flight simulation involved duplication of the spaceflight conditions and experimental protocol in a 1G environment. Postflight, but not postsimulation, electromyographic (EMG) recordings revealed clonus-like activity in all muscles. Compared with preflight, the cycle period and burst durations of the primary extensors (Sol, MG, and VL) tended to decrease postflight. These decreases were associated with shorter steps. The flexor (TA) EMG burst duration postflight was similar to preflight, whereas the burst amplitude was elevated. Consequently, the Sol:TA and MG:TA EMG amplitude ratios were lower following flight, reflecting a \"flexor bias.\" Together, these alterations in mean EMG amplitudes reflect differential adaptations in motor-unit recruitment patterns of flexors and extensors as well as fast and slow motor pools. Shorter cycle period and burst durations persisted throughout the 20-day postflight testing period, whereas mean EMG returned to preflight levels by 17 days postflight. Compared with presimulation, the simulation group showed slight increases in the cycle period and burst durations of all muscles. Mean EMG amplitude decreased in the Sol, increased in the MG and VL, and was unchanged in the TA. Thus adaptations observed postsimulation were different from those observed postflight, indicating that there was a response unique to the microgravity environment, i.e., the modulations in the nervous system controlling locomotion cannot merely be attributed to restriction of movement but appear to be the result of changes in the interpretation of load-related proprioceptive feedback to the nervous system. Peak MG tendon force amplitudes were approximately two times greater post- compared with preflight or presimulation. Adaptations in tendon force and EMG amplitude ratios indicate that the nervous system undergoes a reorganization of the recruitment patterns biased toward an increased recruitment of fast versus slow motor units and flexor versus extensor muscles. Combined, these data indicate that some details of the control of motor pools during locomotion are dependent on the persistence of Earth's gravitational environment.","pdfUrls":["http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/81/5/2451.full.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02d72da86d0f7fffdcf4bf49709ab8c46c5eee41","title":"Effects of spaceflight on rhesus quadrupedal locomotion after return to 1G.","venue":"Journal of neurophysiology","year":1999}

In this paper, we propose a gender and age estimation system that is robust against pose variations. The acceptable facial pose range is a yaw (left-right) from -30 degrees to +30 degrees and a pitch (up-down) from -20 degrees to +20 degrees. According to our experiments on several large databases collected under real environments, the gender estimation accuracy is 84.8% and the age estimation accuracy is 80.9% (subjects are divided into 5 classes). The average processing time is about 70 ms/frame for gender estimation and 95 ms/frame for age estimation (Pentium4 3.2 GHz). The system can be used to automatically analyze shopping customers and pedestrians using surveillance cameras.","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1180995.1181025"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02dad925a3afa1b8bb08f1248143b5e30d6ac2a5","title":"Gender and age estimation system robust to pose variations","venue":"ICMI","year":2006}

comprehension is resistant to acoustic distortion in the input, reflecting listeners' ability to adjust perceptual processes to match the speech input. For noise-vocoded sentences, a manipulation that removes spectral detail from speech, listeners' reporting improved from near 0% to 70% correct over 30 sentences (Experiment 1). Learning was enhanced if listeners heard distorted sentences while they knew the identity of the undistorted target (Experiments 2 and 3). Learning was absent when listeners were trained with nonword sentences (Experiments 4 and 5), although the meaning of the training sentences did not affect learning (Experiment 5). Perceptual learning of noise-vocoded speech depends on higher level information, consistent with top-down, lexically driven learning. Similar processes may facilitate comprehension of speech in an unfamiliar accent or following cochlear implantation.","pdfUrls":["http://spin.ecn.purdue.edu/fmri/PDFLibrary/DavisM_JEPGen_2005_134_222_241.pdf","http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/personal/pubs/davis_et_al_JEPG_2005.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02db3d753b61c138054ca8dd0862576f2689ba62","title":"Lexical information drives perceptual learning of distorted speech: evidence from the comprehension of noise-vocoded sentences.","venue":"Journal of experimental psychology.

A Chinese revision of the s-EMBU by the authors was administered to a total of 779 high school students, ages 11 to 19 years. Exploratory factor analysis with half of the sample yielded a three-factor solution of Rejection, Emotional Warmth, and Overprotection, accounting for 47.1% of the total variance onthe father form and 48.8% of the total variance on the mother form. Then, confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit of the three-factor model to the data in the other half of the sample. The three subscales consisted of 6, 6, and 7 items, respectively. Scores on these subscales had Cronbach alphas ranging from .71 to .81, indicating adequate internal consistency. These psychometric properties suggest its applicability for research with Chinese adolescents.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02dce798a341661510b8a925cb8722d07297df21","title":"Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of a short-form of the EMBU among Chinese adolescents.","venue":"Psychological reports","year":2012}

Creating RT links is a laborious and resource-consuming task. Information Retrieval (IR) techniques are useful to automatically recover traceability links. However, IR-based approaches typically have low accuracy (precision and recall) and, thus, creating RT links remains a human intensive process. We conjecture that understanding how developers verify RT links could help improve the accuracy of IR-based approaches to recover RT links. Consequently, we perform an empirical study consisting of two controlled experiments. First, we use an eye-tracking system to capture developers' eye movements while they verify RT links. We analyse the obtained data to identify and rank developers' preferred source code entities (SCEs), e.g., class names, method names. Second, we use the ranked SCEs to propose two new weighting schemes called SE/IDF (source code entity/inverse document frequency) and DOI/IDF (domain or implementation/inverse document frequency) to recover RT links combined with an IR technique. SE/IDF is based on the developers preferred SCEs to verify RT links. DOI/IDF is an extension of SE/IDF distinguishing domain and implementation concepts. We use LSI combined with SE/IDF , DOI/IDF , and T F/IDF to show, using two systems, iTrust and Pooka, that LSI DOI/IDF statistically improves the accuracy of the recovered RT links over LSI T F/IDF .","pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSM.2012.6405271","http://www.ptidej.net/publications/documents/ICSM12.doc.pdf","http://www.antoniol.net/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/2012/06405271.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02dda8158e47d95197675e58eeb3b2239ebd9796","title":"An empirical study on requirements traceability using eye-tracking","venue":"ICSM","year":2012}

Participants were asked to endorse old words from one study task (targets), and to reject new test words as well as those from a second study task (non-targets). The study task designated as the target category varied across test phases. The left-parietal ERP old/new effect - the electrophysiological signature of recollection - was reliable for targets and for non-targets in all test phases, consistent with the view that participants recollected information about both of these classes of test word. The contrast between the ERPs evoked by new test words separated according to target designation revealed no reliable differences. These findings contrast with those in a recent study in which the same tasks were used, but in which the accuracy of task judgments was markedly higher (Dzulkifli, M.A., & Wilding, E. L. (2005). Electrophysiological indices of strategic episodic retrieval processing. Neuropsychologia, 43, 1152-1162). In that study, there were reliable differences between the ERPs evoked by the two classes of new words, but reliable left-parietal ERP old/new effects for targets only. In combination, the findings suggest that differences between ERPs evoked by new test words can reflect processes that are important for controlling what kinds of information will and will not be recollected.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02de600daebd49140e22f773c891c4d0b144da3a","title":"Memory retrieval processing: neural indices of processes supporting episodic retrieval.","venue":"Neuropsychologia","year":2006}

Colitis is difficult to detect and monitor noninvasively. The goal of this work was to develop a preclinical imaging method for evaluating colitis. Herein, we report improved MRI methods for detecting and characterizing colitis noninvasively in mice, using high-resolution in vivo MR images and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI studies, which were confirmed by histologic studies in a murine model of colitis. C57Bl6/J male mice were treated with 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium in their drinking water for 5 days to induce colitis. MR images were acquired using a 9.4-T Bruker scanner from 5-25 days following dextran sulfate sodium treatment. In dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI studies, Gd uptake (K(trans)) and its distribution (v(e)) were measured in muscle and normal and inflamed colons after administering Gd-diethyltriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). T(2)-weighted MR images distinguished normal colon from diffusely thickened colonic wall occurring in colitis (P <0.0005) and correlated with histologic features. Values of K(trans) and v(e) obtained from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI were also significantly different in inflamed colons compared to normal colon (P < 0.0005). The results demonstrate that both T(2)-weighted anatomic imaging and quantitative analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data can successfully distinguish colitis from normal colon in mice.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02e07e4467457b73ec2842588877a8c6e8475048","title":"High-resolution magnetic resonance colonography and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in a murine model of colitis.","venue":"Magnetic resonance in medicine","year":2010}

In darkness, the continuous current entering the cone outer segment through cGMP-gated (CNG) channels is carried in part by Ca(2+), which is then extruded back to the extracellular space. The mechanism of Ca(2+) extrusion from mammalian cones is not understood. The dominant view has been that the cone-specific isoform of the Na(+)/Ca(2+), K(+) exchanger, NCKX2, is responsible for removing Ca(2+) from their outer segments. However, indirect evaluation of cone function in NCKX2-deficient (Nckx2(-/-)) mice by electroretinogram recordings revealed normal photopic b-wave responses. This unexpected result suggested that NCKX2 may not be involved in the Ca(2+) homeostasis of mammalian cones. To address this controversy, we examined the expression of NCKX2 in mouse cones and performed transretinal recordings from Nckx2(-/-) mice to determine the effect of NCKX2 deletion on cone function directly. We found that Nckx2(-/-) cones exhibit compromised phototransduction inactivation, slower response recovery and delayed background adaptation. We conclude that NCKX2 is required for the maintenance of efficient Ca(2+) extrusion from mouse cones. However, surprisingly, Nckx2(-/-) cones adapted normally in steady background light, indicating the existence of additional Ca(2+)-extruding mechanisms in mammalian cones.","pdfUrls":["http://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6280&context=open_access_pubs"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02e09cf02c6b766f3d227c0387b1030a9b63d523","title":"The Na+/Ca2+, K+ exchanger 2 modulates mammalian cone phototransduction","venue":"Scientific reports","year":2016}

However, direct evidence for a synchrony code in the thalamus is limited. Here, we directly measure thalamic firing synchrony and its stimulus-induced modulation over time, using simultaneous single unit recordings from individual thalamic barreloids in the rat somatosensory whisker/barrel system. Employing whisker deflections varying in velocity or frequency and a cross-correlation approach, we find systematic changes in both time course and strength of thalamic firing synchrony as a function of stimulus parameters and sensory adaptation. Synchrony develops faster and is greater with higher velocity deflections. Greater firing synchrony reflects stimulus-dependent increases in instantaneous firing rates, greater spike time precision relative to stimulus onset as well as common input that likely arises from divergent trigeminothalamic and corticothalamic neurons. With adaptation, synchrony decreases and takes longer to develop but is more dependent on the cells' common inputs.

These models are natural and direct implementations of the grammar, but they are not efficient, because GB is not a computationally modular theory. This paper investigates one problem related to the tension between building linguistically based parsers and building efficient ones. In particular, the issue of what is a linguistically motivated way of deriving a parser from principle-based theories of grammar is explored. It is argued that an efficient and faithful parser can be built by taking advantage of the way in which principles are stated. To support this claim, two features of an implemented parser are discussed. First, configurations and lexical information are precompiled separately into two tables (an X table and a table of lexical co-occurrence) which gives rise to more compact data structures. Secondly, precomputation of syntactic features (O-roles, case, etc.) results in efficient computation of chains, because it reduces several problems of chain formation to a local computation, thus avoiding extensive search of the tree for an antecedent or extensive backtracking. It is also shown that this method of building long-distance dependencies can be computed incrementally.","pdfUrls":["http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/acl/J/J95/J95-4003.pdf","http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~antho/J/J95/J95-4003.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology/J/J95/J95-4003.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology//J/J95/J95-4003.pdf","http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J95/J95-4003.pdf","http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J/J95/J95-4003.pdf","http://anthology.aclweb.org/J/J95/J95-4003.pdf","http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J95-4003"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02e33de386b739666035e32c52f8b5d8b5956277","title":"Modularity and Information Content Classes in Principle-based Parsing","venue":"Computational Linguistics","year":1995}

However, until recently, few studies had explored its antidepressant effect. The current study attempts to investigate the effect of AS extracts on chronic unpredictable mild stress- (CUMS-) induced depression in rats. Male SD rats were exposed to a CUMS-inducing procedure for 5 weeks, resulting in rodent depressive behaviors that included reduced sucrose consumption and lessened sucrose preference ratios in sucrose preference test, prolonged immobility times and decreased struggling time in force swim test, and decreased locomotor activity in open field test. Moreover, the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK 1/2) were markedly decreased in the hippocampus in depressed rats. However, chronically treating the depressed rats with AS (1 g/kg) normalized their depression-related behaviors and molecular profiles. In conclusion, in the present study, we show that AS extracts exerted antidepressant effects that were mediated by the BDNF signaling pathway: in AS-treated depressed rats, the expression of the BDNF protein and the phosphorylation of its downstream targets (ERK 1/2, CREB) were upregulated in the hippocampus.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02e403450d134f43dbdca6099dd5961bd93b59eb","title":"The Antidepressant Effect of Angelica sinensis Extracts on Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress-Induced Depression Is Mediated via the Upregulation of the BDNF Signaling Pathway in Rats","venue":"Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM","year":2016}

It has been demonstrated that miRNAs serve a crucial role in tissue development and the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. The aim of the current study was to investigate the alterations in miRNA expression in a cultured retinal ganglion cell line (RGC‑5 cells) following ionizing radiation injury. Cultured RGC‑5 cells were exposed to X‑rays at doses of 2, 4, 6 and 8 Gy using a medical linear accelerator. Alterations in cellular morphology were observed under a phase contrast microscope and cell viability was measured using the MTT assay. Subsequent to exposure to X‑ray radiation for 5 days, the viability of RGC‑5 cells was significantly reduced in the 6 and 8 Gy groups, accompanied by morphological alterations. Total RNA was then extracted from RGC‑5 cells and subjected to miRNA microarray analysis subsequent to exposure to 6 Gy X‑ray radiation for 5 days. The results of the microarray analysis indicated that the expression levels of 12 miRNAs were significantly different between the 6 Gy and control groups, including 6 upregulated miRNAs and 6 downregulated miRNAs. To verify microarray results, a reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) analysis was performed. The data obtained from RT‑qPCR analysis was similar to that of the the microarray analysis for alterations in the expression of the 12 miRNAs. The results of the current study indicated that miRNA expression was sensitive to ionizing radiation, which may serve an important role in mechanisms of radiation injury in retinal ganglion cells.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/b5/4f/mmr-12-03-4173.PMC4526037.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02e9ce24f2875b5c91562413b5c0c77c4639b067","title":"Ionizing radiation-induced microRNA expression changes in cultured RGC-5 cells","venue":"Molecular medicine reports","year":2015}

Here, we show that the yeast ubiquitin ligase SCF(Met30) plays a central role in the response to two of the most toxic environmental heavy metal contaminants, namely, cadmium and arsenic. SCF(Met30) inactivates the transcription factor Met4 by proteolysis-independent polyubiquitination. Exposure of yeast cells to heavy metals led to activation of Met4 as indicated by a complete loss of ubiquitinated Met4 species. The association of Met30 with Skp1 but not with its substrate Met4 was inhibited in cells treated with cadmium. Cadmium-activated Met4 induced glutathione biosynthesis as well as genes involved in sulfuramino acid synthesis. Met4 activation was important for the cellular response to cadmium because mutations in various components of the Met4-transcription complex were hypersensitive to cadmium. In addition, cell cycle analyses revealed that cadmium induced a delay in the transition from G(1) to S phase of the cell cycle and slow progression through S phase. Both cadmium and arsenic induced phosphorylation of the cell cycle checkpoint protein Rad53. Genetic analyses demonstrated a complex effect of cadmium on cell cycle regulation that might be important to safeguard cellular and genetic integrity when cells are exposed to heavy metals.","pdfUrls":["http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/16/4/1872.full.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02ec00eb34b9780299d28acb4ac7e29546c2d10b","title":"The yeast ubiquitin ligase SCFMet30 regulates heavy metal response.","venue":"Molecular biology of the cell","year":2005}

Abstract—The effects of packaging on the performance of induc-tively degenerated common-emitter low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) are examined and the equations describing the input impedance, transconductance, voltage gain, and noise figure of the packaged amplifier are derived. From the equations, several guidelines for the LNA design are obtained and a systematic approach for the LNA design can be derived. Furthermore, by applying the formulas , the performance of the amplifier can be readily estimated and optimized in the very early stage of the circuit design, immediately as the process data is available. The measurement results of the implemented 0.35-m SiGe RF front-end with an inductively degenerated common-emitter LNA at 1.575 GHz agree well with calculations and simulations.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02ee507633944ba6650b0d4c550749c29565255f","title":"Analysis of Packaging Effects and Optimization in Inductively Degenerated Common-emitter Low-noise Amplifiers","venue":"","year":2001}

Past systems have treated data as data cubes that could have different dimensions encoded into the rows and columns. Polaris was a new tool which extended the PivotTable idea by building different views using a formal algebra that could interact with a relational database. Polaris combined work from visual specification languages, table based displays and data exploration tools to produce a product that could drill down and roll up data in a fashion that gave a complete overview. The main mode of operation of Polaris was the table, which encoded how records would be viewed. These could be minified and easily compared with other tables. They were familiar to statisticians and they were able to display high dimensional data. By dragging and dropping fields from the relation onto a table, the view changed and created a new visual specification, the underlying language used to retrieve and manipulate data. The data in the table could then be grouped, aggregated, displayed with different visual marks, sorted and partitioned. In order to create tables, a visual specification made of the table configurations, the type of graphics displayed and the detail of the encoding was generated. A formal algebra was proposed in which valid expressions were ordered sequences of symbols with operators. Operators like concatenation, cross product and nesting were used (nesting is very similar to intersection). Users could then choose the type of graphical display. The system presented a list of graphical marks which defined the type of view. For example, choosing bars resulted in a bar graph. They also defined three types of graphics that were helpful in understanding different kinds of data. Ordinal-Ordinal graphics were used for understanding trends in some function mapping O->O. Ordinal-Quantitative graphics were used when a quantitative value was dependent on the ordinal value and the properties of the function mapping O->Q were being studied. Quantitative-Quantitative graphics were used to display the distribution of data and discover causal relationships between two separate data sources. Records were displayed in a variety of visual marks aimed to maximize user efficiency. Shape, size, orientation, and color were all carefully chosen. Allowing users to change the data after being displayed was a key goal. Generating aggregation and statistical summaries was a common task for statisticians.

First, observational scaling of pulse broadening with the pulsar distance is anomalously strong; it is consistent with the standard model only when non-uniform statistics of electron fluctuations along the line of sight are assumed. Second, the observed pulse shapes are consistent with the standard model only when the scattering material is concentrated in a narrow slab between the pulsar and the Earth. We propose that both paradoxes are resolved at once if one assumes stationary and uniform, but non-Gaussian statistics of the electron-density distribution in the interstellar medium. Such statistics must be of Lévy type, and the propagating ray should exhibit a Lévy flight rather than the Gaussian random walk implied by the standard model. We propose that a natural realization of such statistics may be provided by the interstellar medium with random electron-density dis-continuities. A Lévy distribution has a divergent second moment, therefore, the standard approach based on the electron-density correlation function does not apply. We develop a theory of wave propagation in such a non-Gaussian random medium, and demonstrate its good agreement with observations.

We say that a graph G admits a system of µ collective additive tree r-spanners (resp., multiplicative tree t-spanners) if there is a system T (G) of at most µ spanning trees of G such that for any two vertices x, y of G a spanning tree T ∈ T (G) exists such that dT (x, y) ≤ dG(x, y) + r (resp., dT (x, y) ≤ t · dG(x, y)). When µ = 1 one gets the notion of additive tree r-spanner (resp., multiplicative tree t-spanner). It is known that if a graph G has a multiplicative tree t-spanner, then G admits a Robertson-Seymour's tree-decomposition with bags of radius at most ⌈t/2⌉ in G. We use this to demonstrate that there is a polynomial time algorithm that, given an n-vertex graph G admitting a multiplicative tree t-spanner, constructs a system of at most log 2 n collective additive tree O(t log n)-spanners of G. That is, with a slight increase in the number of trees and in the stretch, one can \" turn \" a multiplicative tree spanner into a small set of collective additive tree spanners. We extend this result by showing that if a graph G admits a multiplicative t-spanner with tree-width k − 1, then G admits a Robertson-Seymour's tree-decomposition each bag of which can be covered with at most k disks of G of radius at most ⌈t/2⌉ each. This is used to demonstrate that, for every fixed k, there is a polynomial time algorithm that, given an n-vertex graph G admitting a multiplica-tive t-spanner with tree-width k − 1, constructs a system of at most k(1 + log 2 n) collective additive tree O(t log n)-spanners of G.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2014.06.007","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Feodor_Dragan/publication/229066010_Collective_Additive_Tree_Spanners_of_Bounded_Tree-Breadth_Graphs_with_Generalizations_and_Consequences/links/0deec52322baf77843000000.pdf","http://www.cs.kent.edu/~dragan/Papers2010+/SOFSEM-2013.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.2506v2.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35843-2_18","http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2506"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/02fc628d9fb66fbc7bdde8f79bf5b9e9deb91a6c","title":"Collective Additive Tree Spanners of Bounded Tree-Breadth Graphs with Generalizations and Consequences","venue":"SOFSEM","year":2013}

At the same time, the open, unresolved issues on the basic architecture and design of aspect oriented operating systems puts such adventure beyond the scope of today's short term profit driven research and development programs. Separation of concerns is one of the crucial principles in software design. It is in the heart of software usability and re-usability. Success of object-oriented programming is largely due to the structured way in which it enables to separate the concerns, decompose the deferent concerns and at the same time protect their integrity. Success of object-oriented programming languages lead to a whole culture of object oriented software development and finally, research on objects oriented operating systems and realization of such systems. AOP-Aspect oriented programming has already closed the gap and has matured into AOSD-Aspect-oriented software development. Here we would like to support our proposal why we believe that efforts should be put into exploring the potentials of designing aspect oriented operating systems. • Applications that can mostly benefit from aspect orientation are those that exhibit a high degree of crosscutting concerns. Operating systems are notorio us of their problematic structure due to the high degree of crosscutting concerns. • Distributed systems –most of the challenges listed on this call for white paper proposal such as partial failure, causal ordering, dynamic service partition, QoS control, multi-level distributed resource management are all aspectual properties-hence a distributed system software design that localizes and encapsulates these aspects has a potential to ease the challenge in this direction. • Future operating systems would ne ed to exhibit a higher degree of adaptability. Many features that need to be adaptable are aspectual in nature; with current state of the arts, their implementation crosscuts other features and this is a curial barrier for adaptability. • Reflection – Growing need in intelligent operation systems that wisely manage and adapt to new policies can be practically realized only if implementation of these policies is localized and support conditions and intelligence under which such policies can be evoked. • Integration of real-world physical constrains – Operating systems often hide the detailed implementation of their services.

At random times, the supplier offers the retailer a discount. The inter-arrival times of discounts are exponentially distributed. For the retailer, whether or not to take a discount offer depends on its inventory level. If inventory is below threshold level S, the retailer will order to replenish inventory up to S+Q units. Otherwise, the retailer will pass. At the regular purchase price, the retailer uses the order-up-to reorder point inventory system. The reorder point is r, and the order-up-to quantity is R. The demand of the customer is price-elastic. Depending on its inventory level, the retailer may discounts its selling price to boost up demand. The decision variables are S, Q, R, r, and the selling prices (regular and discount selling price). The simulation experiment covered reasonable range of values for each decision variable.

Within this context, the variability of spike trains has been almost exclusively measured using the coefficient of variation of interspike intervals. However, another important statistical property that has been found in cortical spike trains and is closely associated with their high firing variability is long-range dependence. We investigate the conditions, if any, under which such models produce output spike trains with both interspike-interval variability and long-range dependence similar to those that have previously been measured from actual cortical neurons. We first show analytically that a large class of high-variability integrate-and-fire models is incapable of producing such outputs based on the fact that their output spike trains are always mathematically equivalent to renewal processes. This class of models subsumes a majority of previously published models, including those that use excitation-inhibition balance, correlated inputs, partial reset, or nonlinear leakage to produce outputs with high variability. Next, we study integrate-and-fire models that have (nonPoissonian) renewal point process inputs instead of the Poisson point process inputs used in the preceding class of models. The confluence of our analytical and simulation results implies that the renewal-input model is capable of producing high variability and long-range dependence comparable to that seen in spike trains recorded from cortical neurons, but only if the interspike intervals of the inputs have infinite variance, a physiologically unrealistic condition. Finally, we suggest a new integrate-and-fire model that does not suffer any of the previously mentioned shortcomings. By analyzing simulation results for this model, we show that it is capable of producing output spike trains with interspike-interval variability and long-range dependence that match empirical data from cortical spike trains. This model is similar to the other models in this study, except that its inputs are fractional-gaussian-noise-driven Poisson processes rather than renewal point processes. In addition to this model's success in producing realistic output spike trains, its inputs have long-range dependence similar to that found in most subcortical neurons in sensory pathways, including the inputs to cortex. Analysis of output spike trains from simulations of this model also shows that a tight balance between the amounts of excitation and inhibition at the inputs to cortical neurons is not necessary for high interspike-interval variability at their outputs. Furthermore, in our analysis of this model, we show that the superposition of many fractional-gaussian-noise-driven Poisson processes does not approximate a Poisson process, which challenges the common assumption that the total effect of a large number of inputs on a neuron is well represented by a Poisson process.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/0899766041732413"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/030c655d481f5cb8cb59da18b0635dd91aa6e242","title":"Including Long-Range Dependence in Integrate-and-Fire Models of the High Interspike-Interval Variability of Cortical Neurons","venue":"Neural Computation","year":2004}

The process takes a stochastic matrix as input, and then alternates ow expansion and ow innation, each step deening a stochastic matrix in terms of the previous one. Flow expansion corresponds with taking the k th power of a stochastic matrix, where k 2 IN. Flow innation corresponds with a parametrized operator ?r, r 0, which maps the set of (column) stochastic matrices onto itself. The image ?rM is obtained by raising each entry in M to the r th power and rescaling each column to have sum 1 again. In practice the process converges very fast towards a limit which is idempotent under both matrix multiplication and innation, with quadratic convergence around the limit points. The limit is in general extremely sparse and the number of components of its associated graph may be larger than the number associated with the input matrix. This uncoupling is a desired eeect as it reveals structure in the input matrix. The innation operator ?r is shown to map the class of matrices which are diagonally similar to a symmetric matrix onto itself. The term diagonally positive semi{deenite (dpsd) is used for matrices which are diagonally similar to a positive semi{deenite matrix. It is shown that for r 2 IN and for M a stochastic dpsd matrix, the image ?rM is again dpsd. Determinantal inequalities satissed by a dpsd matrix M imply a natural ordering among the diagonal elements of M, generalizing a mapping of nonnegative column allowable idempo-tent matrices onto overlapping clusterings. The spectrum of ?1M, for dpsd M, is of the form f0 n?k ; 1 k g, where k is the number of endclasses of the ordering associated with M, and n is the dimension of M. Reductions of dpsd matrices are given, a connection with Hilbert's distance and the contraction ratio deened for nonnegative matrices is discussed, and several conjectures are made.

Scheimpflug images were made of 65 subjects between 16 and 51 years of age, who were able to accommodate at least 1D. The Scheimpflug images were corrected for distortion due to the geometry of the camera and the refraction of the cornea and anterior lens surface, which is necessary to determine the real shape of the lens. To ensure accurate correction for the refraction of the anterior lens surface, the refractive index of the crystalline lens must be determined. Therefore, axial length was also measured, which made it possible to calculate the equivalent refractive index of the lens and possible changes in this index during accommodation. The results show that during accommodation there is a decrease in both the anterior and the posterior radius of the lens, although the change in mm per diopter of the latter is much smaller. The increase in lens thickness with accommodation is higher than the decrease in the anterior chamber depth, indicating that the posterior lens surface moves backwards with accommodation. During accommodation the anterior lens surface becomes more hyperbolic. Furthermore, an increase in the equivalent refractive index during accommodation was determined.","pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042698904003876","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698904003876"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0319cc223d7518f7586d33e4904132cc0bb85df9","title":"Change in shape of the aging human crystalline lens with accommodation","venue":"Vision Research","year":2005}

The biology implicated in the homeostasis of pathological stress mechanisms is not fully established. One of the difficulties with current techniques is the limitation in capturing chronic levels of cortisol as an expression of stress levels in humans. Hair samples can be used to evaluate cortisol levels averaged over relatively long periods of time, therefore providing a more valid measure of chronic levels of this hormone. A highly replicable technique to measure long-term cortisol could prove pivotal in improving our understanding of the role of stress in psychiatric disorders.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis review synthesises all the published studies relating hair cortisol concentration (HCC) to stress and to psychiatric disorders. It describes and summarises their findings with the aim of providing a summary picture of the current state of this line of research.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe strongest finding to date is the replicable increases in hair cortisol associated with stressful life events. Findings in psychiatric disorders are more sparse and inconsistent. There is some support for the presence of raised HCC in major depressive disorders, and for lowered HCC in posttraumatic stress disorder, suggesting chronic hypercortisolaemia and hypocortisolaemia respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHCC is a promising methodology to study chronic cortisol levels with the potential to help characterise psychiatric and stress related disorders. The combination of chronic and acute cortisol measurements has the potential for more accurately determining different aspects of the stress response, and ultimately for the development of a biological marker to aid diagnosis and response to treatment.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/031a8f47478ee3c295c0b5cdc11c4783e4d402ba","title":"The relationship between cortisol, stress and psychiatric illness: New insights using hair analysis.","venue":"Journal of psychiatric research","year":2015}

The dichotomy in compulsory transfer is the conflict between the medical benefit to the patient and the demand for safety by the family and local residents. A triage system focusing on both the degree of risk to others and the necessity of treatment was thus implemented by Gunma Prefecture in the late 1990s, with the IC established as a compulsory transfer center. IC outreach activities commenced due to requests from healthcare centers and local authorities. For those patients deemed by the IC as requiring treatment, voluntary psychiatric examination is promoted where possible. However, the potential for and methods of crisis intervention through involuntary treatment via compulsory transfer are also explained to patients, families and local residents. Support for relapse prevention can also be provided following involuntary hospitalization via compulsory transfer. In this way, the IC, which is in charge of compulsory transfer and conducts outreach activities in cooperation with healthcare centers and local authorities, considers the demand for safety by the local community while respecting the medical benefit to the patient. Furthermore, as the IC is an administrative body rather than a hospital, a treatment contract with the patient is not always necessary and involvement can continue even in the face of patient resistance. We present herein the case of a patient who, together with his family, strongly rejected medical and welfare involvement. The changing situation surrounding the patient and family was appropriately handled through continued outreach activity support. Consent for this case presentation was obtained from the patient and family following explanation that no personally identifiable information would be revealed.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0322612aa1c007034cfd3fd4f38152e1b064429a","title":"[Administrative-based outreach activities in Gunma Prefecture: preventative crisis intervention via a \"compulsory transfer center\"].","venue":"Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica","year":2012}

In the latter, the goal is to develop a problem-domain independent strategy to automatically generate a good performing heuristic for specific problems, that is, the input to the algorithm are problems and the output are problem-tailored heuristics. This can be done, for example, by automatically selecting and combining different low-level heuristics into a problem specific and effective strategy. Thus, hyper-heuristics raise the level of generality on automated problem solving by attempting to select and/or generate tailored heuristics for the problem in hand. Some approaches like genetic programming have been proposed for this. In this paper, we report on an alternative methodology that sheds light on simple methodologies that efficiently cooperate by means of local interactions. These entities are seen as building blocks, the combination of which is employed for the automated manufacture of good performing heuristic search strategies. We present proof-of-concept results of applying this methodology to instances of the well-known symmetric TSP. The goal here is to demonstrate feasibility rather than compete with state of the art TSP solvers. This TSP is chosen only because it is an easy to state and well known problem.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-12538-6_8","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/German_Terrazas/publication/220948254_Discovering_Beneficial_Cooperative_Structures_for_the_Automated_Construction_of_Heuristics/links/0fcfd5114cb9e1dca5000000.pdf","http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gzt/papers/dbcs4ach.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03230bf59fa6b8e739ae3343bb9f90b07afa91c1","title":"Discovering Beneficial Cooperative Structures for the Automated Construction of Heuristics","venue":"NICSO","year":2010}

There are many adaptive algorithms for different problems. However the techniques are often application specific. In many distributed systems it may happen that the same problem has multiple protocols, each of which performs differently under different environments. In such cases adaptation can be achieved by dynamically switching between them as the environment changes. In this paper we illustrate the idea of designing adaptive distributed system using protocol switching by presenting an adaptive broadcast protocol that uses either a BFS tree or a DFS tree depending on the load of the system, both trees being rooted at the broadcast source. At low load a BFS tree is used as it reduces the broadcast delay (since the distance of any node from the root is always minimum in a BFS tree) while still keeping the load on any one node low. However at higher load a DFS tree is used to reduce the load on any one node since the degree of a node in a DFS tree is generally lower than that in a BFS tree. So the broadcast adapts to the network load by dynamically switching between a BFS tree and a DFS tree. In the proposed scheme, the switching is done by a middleware layered below the broadcast protocol. This separates the adaptation from the application and no change is needed in the application. We also ensure the application layer property that every broadcast message is correctly delivered to all the nodes, including messages sent when the switching is in progress. We assume the asynchronous model of distributed system with reliable but non-FIFO channels. Also it is assumed that no failure occurs during the switching. The message complexity of the algorithm that switches to a DFS tree is <i>O(|E|)</i> and is presented in the next section. The algorithm that switches to a BFS tree needs <i>O(|V||E|)</i> messages and is omitted in this paper due to lack of space.","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1244002.1244136"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03233e69267b098200cc057c1211281ebf4ee52d","title":"Adaptive broadcast by distributed protocol switching","venue":"SAC","year":2007}

Second, each particle tracks only the \" essential state vector \" thus leading to reduced dimensional inference. In addition, we describe how the approach will apply to more general mixture models of current interest in the literature; it is hoped that this will inspire a greater number of researchers to adopt sequential Monte Carlo methods for fitting their sophisticated mixture based models.

We propose dynamical decoupling schemes, that use only bounded-strength controls, for quantum many-body systems with local system Hamiltonians and local environmental couplings. To do so, we introduce the combinatorial concept of balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays (BOAs) and show how to construct them from classical error-correcting codes. The derived decoupling schemes may be useful as a primitive for more complex schemes, e.g., for Hamiltonian simulation. For the case of n qubits and a 2-local Hamiltonian, the length of the resulting decoupling scheme scales as O(n log n), improving over the previously best-known schemes that scaled quadrat-ically with n. More generally, using balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays constructed from families of BCH codes, we show that bounded-strength decoupling for any-local Hamiltonian, where 2, can be achieved using decoupling schemes of length at most O(n −1 log n).","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.00408v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.00408v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00408","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.00408v1.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2016.2535183","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.00408v2.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/032f56d6c2f23d158dfcb27dd1a112626a2ecfc0","title":"Improved Bounded-Strength Decoupling Schemes for Local Hamiltonians","venue":"IEEE Trans.

Until now, the exact biochemical processes that occur during the healing of metaphyseal fractures remain unclear. Diagnostic instruments that allow a dynamic insight into the fracture healing process are as yet unavailable. In the present matched pair analysis, we study the time course of the osteoanabolic markers bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), as well as the osteocatabolic markers crosslinked C-telopeptide of type-I-collagen (β-CTX) and serum band 5 tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP5b), during the healing of fractures that have a low level of bone mineral density (BMD) compared with fractures that have a normal BMD. Between March 2007 and February 2009, 30 patients aged older than 50 years who suffered a metaphyseal fracture were included in our study. BMDs were verified by dual energy Xray absorptiometry (DXEA) scans. The levels of BTMs were examined over an 8-week period. Osteoanabolic BAP levels in those with low levels of BMD were significantly different from the BAP levels in those with normal BMD. BAP levels in the former group increased constantly, whereas the latter group showed an initial strong decrease in BAP followed by slowly rising values. Osteocatabolic β-CTX increased in the bone of the normal BMD group constantly, whereas these levels decreased significantly in the bone of the group with low BMD from the first week. TRAP5b was significantly reduced in the low level BMD group. With this work, we conduct first insights into the molecular biology of the fracture healing process in patients with low levels of BMD that explains the mechanism of its fracture healing. The results may be one reason for the reduced healing qualities in bones with low BMD.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03320c8f0c77b5b31605058ce0a7e73e078f6336","title":"Characteristics of Bone Turnover in the Long Bone Metaphysis Fractured Patients with Normal or Low Bone Mineral Density (BMD)","venue":"PloS one","year":2014}

This spanning tree method is extended to three dimensions to define a Truchet surface with properties similar to its two-dimensional counterpart.

During an 80 minute rugby union match, a player will physically engage in the tackle contest, whether as a ball-carrier or tackler, between 10 to 35 times depending on the position of the player (Deutsch et al., 2007; Quarrie and Hopkins, 2008). During a match, tight forwards (position numbers 1-5, who primarily compete in the set phases such scrums and lineouts) engage in the tackle approximately 10-25 times, loose forwards (position numbers 6-8, who mainly competes for possession of the ball at rucks and assist the tight forwards in set pieces) are involved in 25-35 tackles, inside backs (position numbers 9,10,12,13, whose key responsibility is to execute tactics and distribute the ball) competes in 20-25 tackles, and outside backs (position numbers 11,14,15, who are typically quicker and expected to run into open spaces to cross the advantage line and score points) engage in 10-15 tackles (Deutsch et al., 2007; Quarrie and Hopkins, 2008). It follows that a player requires a high level of skill, physical tolerance and resistance to fatigue to repeatedly engage safely and effectively in the tackle. Understanding the physical demands of a tackle is important with many applications. Examples of these applications include the design and development of proper training drills and equipment, planning and management of training and recovery between training sessions and matches. Also, a better understanding of the physical demands contributes to the implementation of strategies designed to reduce the risk of injury and enables replicating the event in the laboratory for research Recently, methods to estimate the magnitude of impact (energy distributed between ball-carrier and tackler upon contact) in real match tackle contests have been developed to further our understanding of the physical demands of the tackle contest (Hendricks et al., 2014). The physical demand of the tackle was determined by calculating the amount of energy distributed between the ball-carrier and tackler upon contact. This excess of energy may cause muscle damage and injury to the mus-culoskeletal system (Takarada, 2003). The estimated magnitudes of impact ranged from 902 joules (J) to 7608 J for front-on tackles, and 595 J to 6209 J for side-on tackles (Hendricks et al. 2014).

Unlike coherently detected signals, the modulation index of the waveform does not need to be rational with a small denominator, and the oscillator only needs to be stable for the duration of a small group of symbols. The receiver is analyzed in terms of its symmetric information rate, demonstrating its potential when a capacity-approaching code is used and enabling the joint optimization of code rate and modulation index under a bandwidth constraint. The information-theoretic results are corroborated by bit-error-rate curves generated using a standardized turbo code in conjunction with iterative demodulation and decoding. It is shown that, while more robust than a system with coherent reception, the proposed system offers superior energy efficiency compared with conventional single-symbol noncoherent reception.","pdfUrls":["http://csee.wvu.edu/~mvalenti/documents/59ValentiChengTorrieriMilcom.pdf","http://www.cs.wvu.edu/~mvalenti/documents/59presentation.pdf","http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~mvalenti/documents/59presentation.pdf","http://www.ece.wvu.edu/~mvalenti/documents/J20VaChToTComm2010.pdf","http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~mvalenti/documents/59ValentiChengTorrieriMilcom.pdf","http://www.ece.wvu.edu/~mvalenti/documents/59ValentiChengTorrieriMilcom.pdf","http://www.ece.wvu.edu/~mvalenti/documents/59presentation.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.07.090453","http://csee.wvu.edu/~mvalenti/documents/59presentation.pdf","http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~mvalenti/documents/J20VaChToTComm2010.pdf","http://csee.wvu.edu/~mvalenti/documents/J20VaChToTComm2010.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0334c28299492c8da66a5e2b4e54e4edc40b436a","title":"Iterative Multisymbol Noncoherent Reception of Coded CPFSK","venue":"IEEE Trans.

Recently, comprehensive data about the structure and function of glycans have been accumulated, therefore the need for methods and algorithms to analyze these data is growing fast.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThis article presents novel methods for classifying glycans and detecting discriminative glycan motifs with support vector machines (SVM). We propose a new class of tree kernels to measure the similarity between glycans. These kernels are based on the comparison of tree substructures, and take into account several glycan features such as the sugar type, the sugar bound type or layer depth. The proposed methods are tested on their ability to classify human glycans into four blood components: leukemia cells, erythrocytes, plasma and serum. They are shown to outperform a previously published method. We also applied a feature selection approach to extract glycan motifs which are characteristic of each blood component. We confirmed that some leukemia-specific glycan motifs detected by our method corresponded to several results in the literature.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nSoftwares are available upon request.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nDatasets are available at the following website: http://web.kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp/supp/yoshi/glycankernel/","pdfUrls":["http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/glycan_bioinfo07.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btm090","http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/23/10/1211.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03355cf55263aa4f3b05caa3c4b0ca63d7bdc5f7","title":"Glycan classification with tree kernels","venue":"Bioinformatics","year":2007}

Previous studies showed that nucleotide excision DNA repair is downregulated in postmitotic muscle cells and neurons. Here, we characterize DNA damage susceptibility and base excision DNA repair (BER) capacity in undifferentiated and differentiated human neural cells. The results show that undifferentiated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells are less sensitive to oxidative damage than their differentiated counterparts, in part because they have robust BER capacity, which is heavily attenuated in postmitotic neurons. The reduction in BER activity in differentiated cells correlates with diminished protein levels of key long patch BER components, flap endonuclease-1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and ligase I. Thus, because of their higher BER capacity, proliferative neural progenitor cells are more efficient at repairing DNA damage compared with their neuronally differentiated progeny.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/033766642d4f737d20e241eae19591f2f8d724e3","title":"Modulation of DNA base excision repair during neuronal differentiation.","venue":"Neurobiology of aging","year":2013}

An arriving best-effort call is assumed to have a fixed amount of traffic to send, so the transmission rate assigned to it determines the duration of the call. We allow for multi-services (so that mobile stations have different quality of service requirements). Unlike some previous published work where soft blocking was considered (and the system was thus allowed to operate beyond capacity), we assume that a call admission mechanism is implemented in order to prevent a new call to arrive when the system is already saturated. This guarantees the quality of service of ongoing calls. Our first result is that slowing the transmission rates in the case of a single cell with homogeneous quality of service characteristics increases capacity. This suggests that there is a limit capacity that can be approached when slowing down the transmission rates. We identify this limit and show that it has the following property: as long as the arrival rate of information is below some level, blocking probability can become arbitrarily small by sufficiently slowing down the transmission rates. We then extend the results to the general heterogeneous and multi-cell case.","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/570645.570671","http://www-sop.inria.fr/mistral/personnel/Eitan.Altman/PAPERS/mobicom02.ps","http://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2002/papers/032-altman.pdf","http://www.acm.org/sigmobile/mobicom/2002/papers/032-altman.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03386d28efec0f2eb4109d8cbbe4e8eafd7c629d","title":"Capacity of multi-service cellular networks with transmission-rate control: : a queueing analysis","venue":"MobiCom","year":2002}

The oft-cited definition of an Alexandrian pattern , a solution to a problem in a context \" , stimulates the definition of patterns from knowledge and expertise in any domain. Indeed, their application has spread from the object-oriented community, who first adopted them, through different software areas including human-computer interaction, virtual environments , ubiquitous computing, hypermedia and web engineering. This kind of patterns that describe successful solutions to recurring design problems in terms of a specific domain of application are known as domain-specific patterns. The increasing number of available design patterns is making difficult to find the most appropriate one given a specific problem since this task requires mastery on existing design patterns. Hence, there is a need to introduce a formalism to describe them accurately and to allow a rigorous reasoning process to assist users to retrieve those patterns that solve their problems. With this purpose, we propose a semantic representation for domain-specific patterns based on the domain knowledge for which they were written and for which an ontology-based approach is applied. This representation is used as an underlying armature for complementing the informal textual pattern description by means of semantic annotations. The combination of the literary pattern representation with its formal representation counterpart could assist an intelligent search engine that supports users not just for retrieval purposes but also for the discovery useful design solutions improving, therefore, their ability to develop quality software.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11518358_11","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paloma_Diaz/publication/220798316_A_Semantic_Representation_for_Domain-Specific_Patterns/links/0fcfd50cbcd2035303000000.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0338c4efadb17a9ec0f52c63dbfb366e0b029068","title":"A Semantic Representation for Domain-Specific Patterns","venue":"Metainformatics","year":2004}

The investments required to perform such human studies often outweigh the need to publish. As such, the goal of this work (and toolkit) is to enable the evaluation of software visualizations of real-life software systems by its actual developers, as well as to understand the factors that influence adoption. The approach is to directly assist practicing software developers with visualizations through open and online collaboration tools. The mechanism by which we accomplish this goal is an online service that is linked through the projects' revision-control and build systems. We are calling this system SPIDER SENSE, and it includes web-based visualizations for software exploration that is supported by tools for mirroring development activities, automatic building and testing, and automatic instrumentation to gather dynamic-analysis data. In the future, we envision the system and toolkit to become a framework on which further visualizations and analyses are developed. SPIDER SENSE is open-source and publicly available for download and collaborative development. I. INTRODUCTION The SPIDER SENSE toolkit is a platform to assist de-velopers' comprehension of their software systems, and re-searchers' evaluation of software-visualization and software-comprehension tools. It is made with the intention of creating a symbiotic relationship between software-engineering (and software-visualization) researchers and software developers. Software-visualization researchers seek to enable better insight , understanding, and exploration of software subjects for tasks such as understanding architecture, finding bugs, understanding commit patterns, and assessing code coverage. Each of these example tasks can be generalized to be that of a steep learning curve problem for practicing software developers, engineers, and project managers. However, software-visualization researchers often experience difficulty demonstrating direct impact on software-development practice. There have been some significant and notable examples of such direct impact, such as the SEESOFT visualization, which can be seen in the currently popular SUBLIME TEXT editor and development tool. However, much of software-visualization research has impacted practice through more indirect routes. Despite the advantages of such direct application of research , researchers are often reluctant to put their research techniques and tools into practice. Research prototypes of techniques often suffer from immaturity in their implementations,","pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/VISSOFT.2015.7332438","http://www.ics.uci.edu/~vpalepu/publications/vissoft15_reddy_etal.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0339d5bec0f0e2d24bf8f5baca37c845a2585453","title":"SPIDER SENSE: Software-engineering, networked, system evaluation","venue":"VISSOFT","year":2015}

However, there is limited understanding of the flow fields in these bioreactors, and optimum culture conditions are yet to be determined. This article presents the experimental characterization of the flow field within a spinner flask at varying speeds (10 RPM to 80 RPM) and impeller positions. An optical, non-invasive measurement technique, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), was employed to illustrate the fluid flow and calculate the stresses and vorticity associated with the flow within the flask. The largest recirculation structure was observed in the meridional plane at the highest impeller position while the highest shear stress region was observed at the base of the spinner flask. The study provides an overview of the fluid structure within the spinner flask in the meridional and azimuthal planes. Furthermore, the results presented in this study give an accurate quantification of the range of stresses for the given impeller speeds. These results provide estimates of the biomechanical properties within the type of spinner flask used in many published cell studies.","pdfUrls":["http://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/2/4/753/pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0339ec5a46c6b4ae75ac5326bdcf81fc49dcf844","title":"Experimental Characterisation of Fluid Mechanics in a Spinner Flask Bioreactor","venue":"","year":2014}

However, finding optimal Bayesian Network (BN) is NP-hard. Thus, heuristic approaches have sought to effectively solve this problem. In this work, we develop a hybrid search method combining Simulated Annealing with a Greedy Algorithm (SAGA). SAGA explores most of the search space by undergoing a two-phase search: first with a Simulated Annealing search and then with a Greedy search. Three sets of background-corrected and normalized microarray datasets were used to test the algorithm. BN structure learning was also conducted using the datasets, and other established search methods as implemented in BANJO (Bayesian Network Inference with Java Objects). The Bayesian Dirichlet Equivalence (BDe) metric was used to score the networks produced with SAGA. SAGA predicted transcriptional regulatory relationships among genes in networks that evaluated to higher BDe scores with high sensitivities and specificities. Thus, the proposed method competes well with existing search algorithms for Bayesian Network structure learning of transcriptional regulatory networks.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2014.08.010"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/033b89046d8d9c11e34a101147192ddfd835bd45","title":"SAGA: A hybrid search algorithm for Bayesian Network structure learning of transcriptional regulatory networks","venue":"Journal of Biomedical Informatics","year":2015}

in the field of computer vision, there have been many attempts to obtain a symbolic shape description of an object by fitting simple primitives to the range data of the object. In this paper, we introduce the \"<i>Blobby Model</i>\" for automatically generating a shape description from range data. This model can express a 3D surface as an isosurface of a scalar field which is produced by a number of field generating primitives. The fields from many primitives are blended with each other and can form a very complicated shape. To determine the number and distribution of primitives required to adequately represent a complex 3D surface, an energy function is minimized which measures the shape difference between the range data and the \"<i>Blobby Model</i>\". We start with a single primitive and introduce more primitives by splitting each primitive into two further primitives so as to reduce the energy value. In this manner, the shape of the 3D object is slowly recovered as the isosurface produced by many primitives. We have successfully applied this method to human face range data and typical results are shown. The method herein does not require any prior range segmentation.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall05/Papers/muraki91.pdf","http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall13b/Papers/Muraki91.pdf","http://hyperfun.org/FHF_Log/MurakiBlobbyReconst.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/122718.122743"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/033e71bfa6ec172ed6a243342fbc6a037f90635c","title":"Volumetric shape description of range data using \"Blobby Model\"","venue":"SIGGRAPH","year":1991}

We performed single-molecule experiments using magnetic tweezers to determine the effects of H1 on naked DNA in buffer or during chromatin assembly in Xenopus egg extracts. In buffer, nanomolar concentrations of H1 induce bending and looping of naked DNA at stretching forces below 0.6 pN, effects that can be reversed with 2.7-pN force or in 200 mM monovalent salt concentrations. Consecutive tens-of-nanometer bending events suggest that H1 binds to naked DNA in buffer at high stoichiometries. In egg extracts, single DNA molecules assemble into nucleosomes and undergo rapid compaction. Histone H1 at endogenous physiological concentrations increases the DNA compaction rate during chromatin assembly under 2-pN force and decreases it during disassembly under 5-pN force. In egg cytoplasm, histone H1 protects sperm nuclei undergoing genome-wide decondensation and chromatin assembly from becoming abnormally stretched or fragmented due to astral microtubule pulling forces. These results reveal functional ramifications of H1 binding to DNA at the single-molecule level and suggest an important physiological role for H1 in compacting DNA under force and during chromatin assembly.","pdfUrls":["http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/heald/Publications/23097493.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/033ff7251421a2083dfc650f21f5b3e40a60b9fe","title":"Histone H1 compacts DNA under force and during chromatin assembly","venue":"Molecular biology of the cell","year":2012}

Antipsychotic medications were shown to stimulate GDNF secretion from C6 glioma cells. The aims of this study were to investigate the serum concentration of GDNF, to monitor the therapeutic effect of atypical antipsychotics related to GDNF levels in drug-free schizophrenia patients, and to examine these levels in relation to psychotic symptoms. We recruited 138 drug-free schizophrenic patients and compared them with 77 matched healthy subjects. All patients were treated with atypical antipsychotic monotherapy. GDNF serum levels and psychiatric symptoms were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks. GDNF levels gradually increased accompanied by a reduction in psychiatric symptoms during antipsychotic therapy. The levels of GDNF in responders were significantly increased after 8 weeks of treatment, however, no significant change was found in non-responders. Furthermore, a negative association between GDNF levels following pharmacotherapy and disease duration in schizophrenic subjects could be observed. The present study suggests that GDNF may be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia and pharmacological treatment.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0340af581c8b1d8f2b818fabd400252179a03d63","title":"Atypical antipsychotic treatment increases glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor serum levels in drug-free schizophrenic patients along with improvement of psychotic symptoms and therapeutic effects.","venue":"Psychiatry research","year":2016}

The model successfully incorporates accurate, multifield thermodynamic, kinetic, and industrial data with computational flow dynamic calculations and thus further unifies the sciences of kinetics and equilibrium thermodynamics. The model is structurally three-dimensional and uses boundary conditions, initial values, and material specifications provided by industrial measurements , laboratory experiments, and a combination of empirical and thermodynamic data. It accounts for fully developed gas flows of gaseous product generated from within the packed bed; the energy associated with chemical reactions, heating, and melting, as well as thermal conductivity and the particle–particle radiation within the burden. The model proves the existence of a narrow, gas–solid reduction zone where the bulk of phosphorus is produced. It shows that fast reaction rates in this narrow reaction zone in combination with long residence times diminish the influence changing reaction rates have on the process. It indicates that most heat exchanged between the new pellets entering the furnace and the gaseous product produced in the reduction zone takes place in the top 0.5 m of the furnace bed. The gaseous product and flow information shows low and recirculating gaseous flow velocity areas that cause dust accumulation.","pdfUrls":["http://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:d7240a10-9361-4470-8714-f781335c9131/scheepers.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0343d3ecf6cc466aba1d43fd9eb19018796b618f","title":"Process Modeling and Optimization of a Submerged Arc Furnace for Phosphorus Production","venue":"","year":2010}

Eating disorders commonly present with nonspecific findings, masquerading as other, more common etiologies of malnutrition and wasting. In low-prevalence populations, these ambiguities can complicate clinicians' diagnostic reasoning, resulting in delayed or missed diagnoses. Method. We report the atypical case of a 51-year-old male with a five-year history of unexplained weight loss despite extensive past medical evaluation. Previous documentation of profound lymphopenia and bone marrow atrophy had not been linked to a known association with eating disorders. Results. Evaluation for medical etiologies of wasting was negative. Following psychiatric evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with an eating disorder, not otherwise specified, and admitted to a specialized nutritional rehabilitation program. Conclusion. The nonspecific clinical history, physical exam, and laboratory abnormalities of eating disorders can make these diagnoses challenging and delay appropriate treatment. Clinicians should consider eating disorders in patients with malnutrition, severe lymphopenias, and gelatinous marrow transformation early in their workup, so as to avoid potentially negative outcomes.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03449fc0da73f5f7682ee86e3e49f930c73715b6","title":"Delayed Diagnoses: Nonspecific Findings and Diagnostic Challenges in Eating Disorders","venue":"Case reports in medicine","year":2009}

None had abnormalities on imaging studies. All had bilateral electrode placements, unilateral seizure onsets, temporal lobectomies, and were followed for a mean of 33 months postoperatively. Sixteen patients (57%) became free of complex partial seizures: 12 had reductions in seizure frequency of at least 50% but were not seizure-free. The only predictor of the seizure-free state was the presence of low voltage fast activity (LVF), in the alpha or beta ranges, localized to one gyrus. This phenomenon occurred in 14/16 seizure-free patients, 2/12 of others (P < 0.001). As seizures progressed, LVF typically increased in amplitude, propagated, and slowed into the theta range. Wave forms were classified into 8 categories based upon their frequency and morphology. Stepwise discriminant analysis of these wave forms, with consideration of whether they were localized or regional, revealed that both frequency and localization were critical for the post-surgical prognosis. The mere presence of a localized seizure onset was unreliable unless the wave form was taken into account. Well-localized rhythmic activity over 8 Hz at seizure onset from epidural subtemporal electrodes predicts surgical success. Slower rhythms imply greater separation in space and time from seizure onset.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03453b48b8f0545ba6d5c8a7123176757bf56030","title":"Ictal EEG wave forms from epidural electrodes predictive of seizure control after temporal lobectomy.","venue":"Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology","year":1992}

Regardless of initiation procedure, the animals maintained lever pressing behavior with ethanol reinforcement, even at ethanol concentrations as high as 40% (v/v). Slightly higher daily session intakes (g/kg) were found at the higher ethanol concentrations following the secondary-conditioning initiation procedure compared with the sucrose-fading technique. When both ethanol and water were concurrently available, the rats showed a high preference for ethanol reinforcement. When varying concentrations of sucrose were substituted for water, the amount of ethanol ingested decreased as the concentration of the alternative sucrose increased. However, if the response requirement for the sucrose was substantially greater than that for ethanol, the rats shifted their responding to the lever associated with ethanol presentation.

The telco will have to choose a Service Creation Environment (SCE) to achieve its goal of rapid and cost effetive service creation. Another key goal will be the portabil-ity of services between Service Architectures (SAs). Both of these goals can be achieved by adopting the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) of the Object Management Group which will facilitate a platform-independent approach to service creation. A MDA implies that all constructs of the SCE will be represented by a model. By specifying a meta-model that describes the models we achieve portability of services across platforms. The meta-model results in a meta-framework which describes SCEs This paper proposes such a meta-framework called Software Engineering based on Modelling for Telecommunications Archi-tectures (SEMTA). SEMTA describes SCEs that have a general platform-independent service creation process that is guided by a methodical telecommunications design process. A SCE built using SEMTA contains a number of viewpoints that are logically linked. This SCE will also contain a number of tools and resources that are defined by a meta-designer to enable the service designer to create services. A key resource is the reusable component called the Facet. Facets were previously defined by the Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture (TINA) Conformance And Testing (CAT) Workgroup for conformance and testing of \" TINA \" products. Facets are redefined as reusable components in an implementation language-and platform-independent manner encompassing a particular functionality. This work has been implemented on the SATINA-NGN trial platform. I. INTRODUCTION Work has been done on the Next Generation Network (NGN) resulting in a general consensus that the NGN consists of an underlying Network Architecture (NA) and a higher layer Service Architecture (SA) which are interoperable with legacy systems. It is accepted that the NA will be a packet-based, QOS-enabled network that presents a point of abstraction to SAs to enable easier service creation. The main aim of a telco will be to create services in the NGN in an economical manner. Creating services within a particular SA is well defined but we are presently posed with a number of SAs. Historically, Intelligent Networks (IN) was the first SA to provide services to the consumer.

Reserves, or no-take areas, have been proposed as a management tool for reducing fisheries-induced selection, but their effectiveness for migratory species has remained unexplored. Here we develop an eco-genetic model to predict the effects of marine reserves on fisheries-induced evolution under migration. To represent a stock that undergoes an annual migration between feeding and spawning grounds, we draw model parameters from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the northern part of its range. Our analysis leads to the following conclusions: (i) a reserve in a stock's feeding grounds, protecting immature and mature fish alike, reduces fisheries-induced evolution, even though protected and unprotected population components mix on the spawning grounds; (ii) in contrast, a reserve in a stock's spawning grounds, protecting only mature fish, has little mitigating effects on fisheries-induced evolution and can sometimes even exacerbate its magnitude; (iii) evolutionary changes that are already underway may be difficult to reverse with a reserve; (iv) directly after a reserve is created or enlarged, most reserve scenarios result in yield losses; and (v) timescale is very important: short-term yield losses immediately after a reserve's creation can give way to long-term gains.","pdfUrls":["http://www.iiasa.ac.at/~dieckman/reprints/DunlopEtal2009a.pdf","http://user.iiasa.ac.at/~dieckman/reprints/DunlopEtal2009a.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0348bed3c9db4ac345d001399a55d38762ba3a1d","title":"Propensity of marine reserves to reduce the evolutionary effects of fishing in a migratory species","venue":"Evolutionary applications","year":2009}

Attempts to solve this problem by a priori grouping of attribute values into distinct subsets has met with limited success. The dynamic ID3 algorithm improves the performance of ID3 on this type of problem by grouping many-valued attributes dynamically as the tree is built.

Certainly, economic theory suggests that it would be easier for a terrorist group to recruit low-income or unemployed individuals since they have a relatively low opportunity cost of time. Moreover, as argued by Crenshaw (1981), people who believe that their economic prospects have been limited by others might have grievances that could attract them to terrorism. Nevertheless, in their meta study, Gassebner and Luechinger (2011) report that the two robust explanatory variables for terrorism are population and various measures of democratic freedom, but not per capita GDP. Their results from 13.4 million different regressions estimated using various combinations of the 65 variables contained in 43 different studies indicate no significant causal effects between terrorism and per capita GDP. We add to the large and growing literature on the relationship between terrorism and poverty in two ways. First, unlike previous studies, we use a data set that decomposes the number of terrorist acts into domestic and transnational incidents. We show that poverty has a very distinct effect on each type of terrorism. Second, we use split sample and smooth transition regression (STaR) estimation techniques to allow for a nonlinear relationship between terrorism and poverty. When we account for the nonlinearities in the data and distinguish between the two types of terrorist events, we find that poverty has as a very strong influence on domestic terrorism and a small, but significant, effect on transnational terrorism.","pdfUrls":["http://www.aeaweb.org/aea/2012conference/program/retrieve.php?pdfid=76"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/035f3a3e524f3d87a22da5074a660574fed06402","title":"The Nonlinear Relationship between Terrorism and Poverty Byline: Poverty and Terrorism","venue":"","year":2011}

Of these, 7 are considered villages with high plague frequency, where human plague was recorded during at least 6 of the 17 plague seasons between 1986 and 2004. In the remaining 5 villages with low plague frequency, plague was either rare or unrecorded. Pulex irritans, known as the human flea, was the predominant flea species (72.4%) in houses. The density of P. irritans, but not of other domestic fleas, was significantly higher in villages with a higher plague frequency or incidence. Moreover, the P. irritans index was strongly positively correlated with plague frequency and with the logarithmically transformed plague incidence. These observations suggest that in Lushoto District human fleas may play a role in plague epidemiology. These findings are of immediate public health relevance because they provide an indicator that can be surveyed to assess the risk for plague.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/80/42/06-1084.PMC2738476.pdf","http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/5/pdfs/06-1084.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/036114fe1659c83d5c8cb3676b58989d38cded01","title":"Plague and the Human Flea, Tanzania","venue":"Emerging infectious diseases","year":2007}

Recently, homozygous and compound heterozygous TREM2 mutations were identified in rare families with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) but without bone involvement. We identified a p.Thr66Met heterozygous mutation in a new consanguineous Italian family. Two sibs had early onset autosomal recessive FTLD without severe bone disorders. Atypical signs were present in this family: early parietal and hippocampus involvement, parkinsonism, epilepsy, and corpus callosum thickness on brain magnetic resonance imaging. This study further demonstrates the implication of TREM2 mutations in FTLD phenotypes. It illustrates the variability of bone phenotype and underlines the frequency of atypical signs in TREM2 carriers. This and previous studies evidence that TREM2 mutation screening should be limited to autosomal recessive FTLD with atypical phenotypes characterized by: (1) a very young age at onset (20-50 years); (2) early parietal and hippocampal deficits; (3) the presence of seizures and parkinsonism; (4) suggestive extensive white matter lesions and corpus callosum thickness on brain magnetic resonance imaging.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0362b993031d87243b2e6c41560acbeddcb00bc1","title":"Homozygous TREM2 mutation in a family with atypical frontotemporal dementia.","venue":"Neurobiology of aging","year":2014}

Study period was between May 10 and June 12. Preoperative, sonographic and intraoperative criteria were considered.\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED\nChi Square test and Receiver Operater Curve (ROC) analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTotal 323 patients were included. On analysis, elderly patients, males, recurrent cholecystitis, obese patients, previous surgery, patients who needed preoperative Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), abnormal serum hepatic and pancreatic enzyme profiles, distended or contracted gall bladder, intra-peritoneal adhesions, structural anomalies or distortions and the presence of a cirrhotic liver on ultrasonography (USG) were identified as predictors of difficult LC. A scoring system tested against the same sample proved to be effective. A ROC analysis was done with area under receiver operator curve of 0.956. A score above 9 was considered difficult with sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 97.8%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrates that a scoring system predicting the difficulty in LC is feasible. There is scope for further refinement to make the same less cumbersome and easier to handle.

Multichannel electromyographic recording showed a rostrocaudal recruitment order for the generalized myoclonic jerk. In all patients, each flash induced a large (36.9 +/- 5.7 microV) frontal biphasic wave with an onset latency of 42 msec that preceded the earliest muscle response in the face by at least 4 msec (range, 4-7 msec), the activity in the biceps by 11 to 14 msec, and the activity in tibialis anterior by 26 to 34 msec. Occipital potentials evoked by the same flash stimulation had a latency of 33.7 msec and were of normal amplitude (2.1 +/- 1.2 microV). Brain-mapping analysis indicated that the frontal activity correlated with the myoclonus originated in the premotor and motor cortices. These findings provide evidence for a cortical origin of this form of stimulus-sensitive myoclonus in humans. Administration of apomorphine and lisuride (intravenously) and levodopa-carbidopa (orally) abolished the photic myoclonus. Intravenous 5-hydroxytryptophan plus carbidopa (orally) and piracetam (orally) were also effective against photic myoclonus. The wide range of drugs active against photic cortical myoclonus suggests the participation of several biochemical mechanisms in its origin.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03676f9afc2c60cf8a2dbcf097358be362532a45","title":"The pathophysiology and pharmacology of photic cortical reflex myoclonus.","venue":"Annals of neurology","year":1993}

Such intention prediction enables each partner to adapt their behaviors to the intent of others, serving a critical role in joint action where parties work together to achieve a common goal. Among behavioral cues, eye gaze is particularly important in understanding a person's attention and intention. In this work, we seek to quantify how gaze patterns may indicate a person's intention. Our investigation was contextualized in a dyadic sandwich-making scenario in which a \"worker\" prepared a sandwich by adding ingredients requested by a \"customer.\" In this context, we investigated the extent to which the customers' gaze cues serve as predictors of which ingredients they intend to request. Predictive features were derived to represent characteristics of the customers' gaze patterns. We developed a support vector machine-based (SVM-based) model that achieved 76% accuracy in predicting the customers' intended requests based solely on gaze features. Moreover, the predictor made correct predictions approximately 1.8 s before the spoken request from the customer. We further analyzed several episodes of interactions from our data to develop a deeper understanding of the scenarios where our predictor succeeded and failed in making correct predictions. These analyses revealed additional gaze patterns that may be leveraged to improve intention prediction. This work highlights gaze cues as a significant resource for understanding human intentions and informs the design of real-time recognizers of user intention for intelligent systems, such as assistive robots and ubiquitous devices, that may enable more complex capabilities and improved user experience.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/38/b3/fpsyg-06-01049.PMC4513212.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03686afbbb854ef995200bd6196d404371466286","title":"Using gaze patterns to predict task intent in collaboration","venue":"Front.

What are the welfare implications of such foreign influence? In this paper we develop a model of foreign influence and apply it to the study of optimal tariffs. We develop a two-country voting model of electoral competition, where we allow the incumbent party in each country to take costly actions that probabilistically affect the electoral outcome in the other country. We show that policies end up maximizing a weighted sum of domestic and foreign welfare, and we study the determinants of this weight. We show that foreign influence may be welfare-enhancing from the point of view of aggregate world welfare because it helps alleviate externalities arising from cross-border effects of policies. Foreign influence can however prove harmful in the presence of large imbalances in influence power across countries. We apply our model of foreign influence to the study of optimal trade policy. We derive a modified formula for the optimal import tariff and show that a country's import tariff is more distorted whenever the influenced country is small relative to the influencing country and whenever natural trade barriers between the two countries are small.

Maximum strength (25% and 26%), CMJ height (36% and 39%), mean power (30% and 35%) and mean propulsive power (22% and 28%) in the loaded jump squat exercise, and 20-m sprint speed (16% and 14%) increased significantly (p≤0.05) following the TT and CT, respectively. However, the transfer effect coefficients (TEC) of strength and power performances to 20-m sprint performance following the TT were greater than the CT throughout the 9-week training period.

Language impairment is an inherent component of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which can also be encountered in depressed patients. The aim of this study wasto compare the profiles of language abilities in late-onset depression and mild AD groups.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 25 patients with late-onset depression (mean age 73.6 ± 6.6 years; schooling 9.1 ± 5.7 years) and 30 patients with mild AD (77.6 ± 5.4 years; 7.5 ± 7.1 years) using the Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders of Dementia (ABCD), compared to a group of 30 controls (73.8 ± 5.8 years; 9.1 ± 5.4 years). Cut-off scores to discriminate between Controls × Depression and Depression × AD were determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDepressed patients' scores were similar to AD in confrontation naming, concept definition, following commands, repetition and reading comprehension (sentence). Episodic memory and mental status subtests were useful in differentiating depressed patients from AD, a result that was reproduced when using analysis of covariance to control for the effect of age in the same subtests (p = 0.01 and 0.04, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLanguage impairment resembling AD was found in the aforementioned language subtests of the ABCD in elderly depressed patients; the mental status and episodic memory subtests were useful to discriminate between AD and depression. The ABCD has proven to be a suitable tool for language evaluation in this population and should aid in the differentiation of AD and pseudodementia (as that of depression).","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0370323148fcb0ff9d18aa05870fea7a4188fe66","title":"Comparison of language impairment in late-onset depression and Alzheimer's disease.","venue":"Acta neuropsychiatrica","year":2011}

Nowadays, different types of applications in areas such as enterprise web, virtual labs and high-performance computing are already being deployed in private and public clouds. However, one of the remaining challenges is how to allow users to specify Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for composite groups of virtual machines and enforce them effectively across the deployed resources. In this paper, we propose an Infrastructure as a Service resource manager capable of allocating Distributed Ensembles of Virtual Appliances (DEVAs) in the Cloud. DEVAs are groups of virtual machines and their network connec-tivities instantiated on heterogeneous shared resources with QoS specifications for individual entities as well as their connections. We discuss the different stages in their lifecycle: declaration, scheduling, provision-ing and dynamic management, and show how this approach can be used to maintain QoS for complex deployments of virtual resources.","pdfUrls":["http://users.cis.fiu.edu/~sadjadi/Publications/Euro-Par-2011-Deva.pdf","http://www.cs.fiu.edu/~sadjadi/Publications/Euro-Par-2011-Deva.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23400-2_43","http://pire.fiu.edu/publications/europar11.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0371e6cbd5e6d4b918b1948fbb92f2c52099766e","title":"DEVA: Distributed Ensembles of Virtual Appliances in the Cloud","venue":"Euro-Par","year":2011}

We diagnosed a severe sepsis with positive blood cultures for Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus with a secondary endocarditis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA recent study suggests that the majority of patients affected by colonic cancer have a Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus colonization that becomes apparent as an overt infection only when immunosystem disorders or cardiac valve lesions occur. This correlation is important for involving more specialists in a correct and early diagnosis of this rare, but potentially fatal, complication.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/02/dc/1752-1947-7-185.PMC3750266.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/037698aae944f003e259d3ee110d771efca7d6df","title":"Correlation among Streptococcus bovis, endocarditis and septicemia in a patient with advanced colon cancer: a case report","venue":"Journal of medical case reports","year":2013}

However, they are areas which have thus far been largely limited to technical specialists, excluding animators, writers, and other artists from the development of interactive content. We attempt to open these fields to non-technologists through an easily extensible platform for the rapid development of social interactions between humans and animatronic characters. Specifically, the Interbots Platform consists of 1) a servo-driven animatronic character named Quasi and 2) a suite of tools to author decisions, animate the character, and design complete, interactive, entertaining social experiences. We have created a graphical editor to author behaviors for the character, as well as extensions for Alias Maya and Macromedia Director, empowering artists already familiar with these applications to create animatronic-enabled content. The usability of the Interbots Platform was verified when interdisciplinary student teams of artists and computer scientists were able to create engaging entertainment experiences with Quasi in two-week development cycles.","pdfUrls":["http://www.etc.cmu.edu/projects/ibi/files/CMU_ETC_ACE05.pdf","http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~mpoor01/DiscertationStuff/Animatronics%20%5BRobotics%5D/CMU_ETC_ACE05.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1178477.1178496"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0376d3c101415c0127e50c4162366cddd466dac7","title":"An extensible platform for interactive, entertaining social experiences with an animatronic character","venue":"Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology","year":2005}

The reciprocal connectivity between the cerebral cortex and the thalamus is believed to play a role in consciousness as well as in various neurological disorders, such as the propagation of seizure activity in epilepsy. Thus, in-vivo analysis of such connectivity is critically important for brain diagnosis and surgery planning. While existing work focuses either on fiber tracking or on the segmentation of thalamic nuclei, currently there is no generally accepted computational framework for the quantitative assessment of thalamo-cortical connectivity. In this paper, (i) we propose a new partitioning paradigm, called coclustering, to model this problem. In contrast to the traditional clustering paradigm, a coclustering procedure not only simultaneously partitions cortical voxels and thalamic voxels into groups, but also identifies the corresponding strong connectivities between the two classes of groups; (ii) we develop the first coclustering algorithm, Genetic Coclustering Algorithm (GCA), to solve the coclustering problem; and (iii) we apply GCA to perform in-vivo analysis of the thalamo-cortico-thalamic connectivity and produce a 3-D visualization of the thalamic nuclei as well as their connectivities to the corresponding cortical regions. then she worked for IBM as a system analyst and project manager, and certified as IBM DB2 expert.

varying correlations are often estimated with multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models that are linear in squares and cross products of the data. A new class of multivariate models called dynamic conditional correlation models is proposed. These have the exibility of univariate GARCH models coupled with parsimonious parametric models for the correlations. They are not linear but can often be estimated very simply with univariate or two-step methods based on the likelihood function. It is shown that they perform well in a variety of situations and provide sensible empirical results.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/78960/Week7Engle_2002.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/037913516165ae0916c9439e5025a46dfc98cfff","title":"Dynamic Conditional Correlation: A Simple Class of Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity Models","venue":"","year":2003}

To address the role of Bmp signaling in the epithelium, we have exploited the fact that Bmp receptor type Ia (Alk3) is expressed in the epithelium during branching morphogenesis. Deletion of Bmpr1a in the epithelium with an Sftpc-cre transgene leads to dramatic defects in lung development. There is reduced epithelial proliferation, extensive apoptosis, changes in cell morphology and extrusion of cells into the lumen. By E18.5, there are fewer Type II cells than normal, and the lung contains large fluid-filled spaces. If cell death is prevented by making embryos homozygous null for the proapoptotic gene, Bax, the epithelial cells that are rescued can apparently differentiate, but normal morphogenesis is not restored. To determine whether Bmps made by the epithelium can function in an autocrine manner, mesenchyme-free endoderm was cultured in Matrigel with Fgfs. Under these conditions, the mutant epithelium fails to undergo secondary budding. Abnormal development was also seen when Bmp4 was specifically deleted in the epithelium using the Sftpc-cre transgene. Our results support a model in which Bmp signaling primarily regulates the proliferation, survival and morphogenetic behavior of distal lung epithelial cells.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cellbio.duke.edu/Faculty/Hogan/Hogan%20pdfs/eblaghie_et_al_06.pdf","http://note.cellbio.duke.edu/Faculty/Hogan/Hogan%20pdfs/eblaghie_et_al_06.pdf","http://note.cellbio.duke.edu/Faculty/Oliver/01eblaghie_et_al_06.pdf","http://www.cellbio.duke.edu/faculty/Oliver/01eblaghie_et_al_06.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03795966a0eb7e5744513b9bd49ceffcf7f0210a","title":"Evidence that autocrine signaling through Bmpr1a regulates the proliferation, survival and morphogenetic behavior of distal lung epithelial cells.","venue":"Developmental biology","year":2006}

Despite a uniform view of the memory, the machines differ significantly in their memory system performance (and may offer slightly different consistency models). Cached and local memory accesses are much faster than remote read accesses to data generated by another processor or remote write to data intentionally pushed to memories close to another processor. The bandwidth from/to cache and local memory can be an order of magnitude (or more) higher than the bandwidth to/from remote memory. The situation is further complicated by the heavy influence of the access pattern (i.e. the spatial locality of reference) on both the local and the remote memory system bandwidth. In these modern machines, a compiler for a parallel system is faced with a number of options to accomplish a data transfer most efficiently. The decision for the best option requires a cost benefit model, obtained in an empirically evaluation of the memory system performance. We evaluate three DEC Alpha based parallel systems, to demonstrate the practicality of this approach. The common DEC-Alpha processor architecture facilitates a direct comparison of memory system performance. These systems are the DEC 8400, the Cray T3D, and the Cray T3E. The three systems differ in their clock speed, their scala-bility and in the amount of coherency they provide. The DEC 8400 is a shared memory, symmetric multiprocessor based on a high speed bus offering sequential consistency; the Cray T3D and T3E are scalable multicomputers based on a scalable 3D torus interconnect and either do not cache remote accesses at all (T3E) or provide only partial memory consistency within a node (T3D) and therefore typically leave consistency to the application or compiler. Our performance characterization shows that although the clock rate of the DEC 8400 doubled compared to the Cray T3D, the DEC 8400 offers only modest improvements in the performance of remote memory operations over the Cray T3D. The local and remote memory system performance of the Cray T3E Personal use of this material is permitted.

Reduction in biological potential of land is a severe threat for development; especially in developing countries, it can affect the overall production of the country. Regular and frequent assessment and mapping of desertification hazard zones is essential to monitor the desertification process. Methodology development for the assessment and mapping of desertification is a crucial task in this process. The current work utilises an expert system approach to map desertification severity. The knowledge-base of the expert system is derived from the knowledge of the expert. The parameters used to map desertification severity are land use/land cover (LU/LC) changes and rainfall trend. Analysis of satellite imagery provides the LU/LC dynamics which is a primary indicator for desertification. Aurangabad District (Maharashtra, India) is selected for analysis. It is a semi-arid region situated in central India. Validation of the methodology is done using a training set consisting of 80 ground-truth points collected from the study area. The proposed model is semi-generic in nature. It can be used to map and monitor desertification hazard frequently and efficiently using different temporal dataset for the same area. This model can be applied to other areas using the local ground-truth data and modifying the knowledge-base as per the local conditions. Rigorous desertification analysis commonly followed is very complex and highly data dependent unlike the current model. Hence this model can be applied for a preliminary estimation of desertification severity with acceptable accuracy using limited field data. This methodology can be extended using other available parameters for better accuracy.","pdfUrls":["http://www.ijetae.com/files/Volume3Issue6/IJETAE_0613_97.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/037dd625447e4366bf97cfa7bec4662693e2ba2c","title":"International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering Mapping of Desertification Severity Using Expert System Approach","venue":"","year":2013}

Although the occluded phenotype (ODV) shares the main structural proteins and its genome with BV, it has been poorly studied in mammals. In this study, we assessed the capacity of ODV to induce immune responses in mice. In contrast to BVs, ODVs failed to promote the secretion of IFN-gamma, IL-6 and Il-12 and to induce antiviral activity against VSV in the short term. Furthermore, ODVs were unable to induce cellular immunity against a coadministered antigen 7 days after inoculation. By analyzing the interaction of ODVs with BMDCs, we observed that although ODVs entered the cells reaching late and acidic endosomes, they did not induce their maturation. Finally, we also analyzed if BVs and ODVs followed different routes in the cell during the infection. BVs, but not ODVs, colocalized with the protein ovalbumin in compartments with the presence of proteases. The results suggest that structural differences could be responsible for their different destinies in the dendritic cell and this could lead to a different impact on the immune response.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0382b4834857700ace95424125b4f12306a650a3","title":"Two Distinctive Phenotypes of AcMNPV Display Different Immune Abilities and Intracellular Destiny","venue":"PloS one","year":2016}

Reference lists of retrieved articles were cross-checked for additional relevant studies.\n\n\nSTUDY SELECTION\nIncluded in this review were studies that reported on the frequency of the specified clozapine-related adverse effects and that either reported on the grounds for or against clozapine discontinuation or reported on management techniques to maintain patients on clozapine or enable successful clozapine rechallenge. The following side effects were considered important for this review as potential grounds for clozapine discontinuation: neutropenia or agranulocytosis, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, eosinophilia, leukocytosis, QTc prolongation, electrocardiogram changes, atrial flutter, tachycardia, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, fever, syncope, diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic hyperosmolar coma, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, ileus, liver enzyme elevation, or seizure.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nStudy results that supported continuation or discontinuation of clozapine or that provided information on management techniques were abstracted.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf a total of 13,385 search results, data from 81 studies were included in this review. Results suggest that prompt discontinuation of clozapine without rechallenge is indicated for agranulocytosis, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and a QTc interval > 500 milliseconds that is confirmed and derived using the appropriate correction method. Clozapine discontinuation with potential rechallenge (provided there is appropriate surveillance and management or prophylactic therapy) is indicated for ileus or subileus, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, venous thromboembolism, and diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma. Neutropenia, leukocytosis, seizures, orthostatic hypotension, severe constipation, and weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, including metabolic syndrome and its components, as well as moderately prolonged myocardial repolarization, need to be managed but do not generally warrant clozapine discontinuation. Eosinophilia, leukocytosis, drug-induced fever, and tachycardia (provided that myocarditis and neuroleptic malignant syndrome are ruled out) can be managed and should rarely lead to clozapine discontinuation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA number of side effects commonly cited as medical reasons for clozapine discontinuation do not necessarily warrant such action. Management techniques are available that allow continuation or rechallenge in relation to a number of clozapine-related side effects.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/038633eba2b4fde1f96627126d15b90b02e5e58c","title":"Termination of clozapine treatment due to medical reasons: when is it warranted and how can it be avoided?","venue":"The Journal of clinical psychiatry","year":2013}

Researchers hoping to obtain precise kinetic data from fluorescence recovery after photobleaching or photoactivation experiments need an easily controllable system for stimulation of a specific region and subsequent imaging, and the Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope (cLSM) with SIM scanner makes this possible. We describe here how to precisely measure off rates using a cytosolic photoactivatable probe that binds endosomal membranes. The diversity of genetically encoded fluorophores has increased since GFP was first cloned in 1992. There are now a variety of GFP mutants spanning much of the visible spectrum. Some of these variants allow photoactivation, such that they increase their fluorescence intensity after exposure to specific wavelengths of light, and using these variants, one can turn on the fluorescent intensity in a region of interest and study the activated proteins over time (for a review, see ref. 1). The photoactivat-able version of GFP (PA-GFP) gains a 100-fold increase in fluorescence (with emission at 517 nm) after exposure to light in the ultraviolet-to-violet range (350–420 nm; ref. 2). Using standard molecular biology techniques, a protein of interest can be linked to a fluorophore. Depending on the fusion partner, this approach can be used to label subcellular organelles, cells of interest and specific tissue regions. This has opened the possibility for in vivo studies of, for example, organelle dynamics and function, protein expression and turnover, protein interaction, and cell motility. Chimeric fluorescent proteins allow studies of dynamic events that range in duration from less than a second up to several days. The measurement and analysis of rapid subsecond kinetics, however, necessitates special requirements for both the microscope hardware and software. The Olympus FluoView FV1000 cLSM is available with a proprietary SIM scanner, which allows the confocal system to simultaneously stimulate and image. Using this setup one can use an independent laser for light stimulation while recording images with the main scanner. Structures of interest can be selected and stimulated during scanning, facilitating accurate measurements immediately after stimulation. For the highest efficiency in photobleaching or photoactivation, a circular or so-called 'Tornado' scan, is possible with the SIM scanner, maximizing the dose of light in the activation or bleaching area. To measure rapid kinetics after photoactivation, it is essential to know the exact interval between stimulation and measurement. The exposure of the stimulating laser can easily …","pdfUrls":["http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v3/n12/pdf/nmeth982.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/038906678405eb6306d23a1863f3dc7d7aed490e","title":"Precise Calculation of Photoactivation Kinetics Measuring Rapid Kinetic Events Measuring in Practice","venue":"","year":2006}

Immunohistochemical staining of the brain using an antibody against pChAT clearly revealed peripheral cholinergic neurons, but failed to detect cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system. In rodents, pChAT-immunoreactivity has been detected in cholinergic parasympathetic postganglionic and enteric ganglion neurons. In addition, pChAT has been observed in non-cholinergic neurons such as peripheral sensory neurons in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. The common type of ChAT (cChAT) has been investigated in many parts of the brain and the spinal cord of non-human primates, but little information is available about the localization of pChAT in primate species. Here, we report the detection of pChAT immunoreactivity in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons and its co-localization with Substance P (SP) and/or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the cynomolgus monkey, Macaca fascicularis. Neurons positive for pChAT were observed in a rather uniform pattern in approximately half of the trigeminal neurons throughout the TG. Most pChAT-positive neurons had small or medium-sized cell bodies. Double-immunofluorescence staining showed that 85.1% of SP-positive cells and 74.0% of CGRP-positive cells exhibited pChAT immunoreactivity. Most pChAT-positive cells were part of a larger population of neurons that co-expressed SP and/or CGRP.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/2d/bf/ahc-046-59.PMC3661780.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/038b893dc166a64629df9e9bf1e223bacf7f77e3","title":"Immunoreactivity for Choline Acetyltransferase of Peripheral-Type (pChAT) in the Trigeminal Ganglion Neurons of the Non-Human Primate Macaca fascicularis","venue":"Acta histochemica et cytochemica","year":2013}

The image reproduces the famous painting by Jan Bruegel, \" The allegory of fire \". It was chosen to illustrate the dual nature of risks: fire can destroy, fire can create. The right hand side of the painting is dominated by a wild conflagration that reduces a building to ashes, the left hand side portrays fire as the energy that men have used for millennia to create objects of everyday use. Any risk, well managed, is an opportunity. ECE/TRADE/390 iii iv v Preface Among the most unsettling, and paradoxical, consequences of globalization has been its effect on risks: while it has great potential to reduce the impact and likelihood of a number of risks – local and global, natural and manmade – it has also helped magnify and spread others. The increasingly complex and intertwined nature of global supply chains spanning continents and oceans has brought many benefits but also directly or indirectly contributed to a wide range of events resulting in loss of life, environmental degradation and economic hardship. Fortunately, another outgrowth of globalization has been …","pdfUrls":["http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trade/Publications/WP6_ECE_TRADE_390.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/038d1176927230ca4d4effdadcd0e26906f82906","title":"Risk Management in Regulatory Systems: Towards a Better Management of Risks","venue":"","year":2012}

We also examined the potential mechanisms by which CLA isomers may alter the incidence of cancer. We found no published reports that examined the effects of purified CLA isomers on human cancer in vivo. Incidence of rat mammary tumors induced by methylnitrosourea was decreased by c9, t11-CLA in all studies and by t10, c12-CLA in just a few that included it. Those 2 isomers decreased the incidence of forestomach tumors induced by benzo (a) pyrene in mice. Both isomers reduced breast and forestomach tumorigenesis. The c9, t11-CLA isomer did not affect the development of spontaneous tumors of the intestine or mammary gland, whereas t10, c12-CLA increased development of genetically induced mammary and intestinal tumors. In vitro, t10, c12-CLA inhibited the growth of mammary, colon, colorectal, gastric, prostate, and hepatoma cell lines. These 2 CLA isomers may regulate tumor growth through different mechanisms, because they have markedly different effects on lipid metabolism and regulation of oncogenes. In addition, c9, t11-CLA inhibited the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway and t10, c12-CLA inhibited the lipooxygenase pathway. The t10, c12-CLA isomer induced the expression of apoptotic genes, whereas c9, t11-CLA did not increase apoptosis in most of the studies that assessed it.

This question is interesting in its own right and is encountered in many applications. But our research has been mainly motivated by a cooperative game associated with the well-known joint replenishment model. By applying our general results on polymatroid optimization, we prove that this cooperative game is submodular (i.e. its characteristic cost function is submodular), if the joint setup cost is a normalized and non-decreasing submodular function. Furthermore, the same result holds true for a more general one-warehouse multiple retailer game, which affirmatively answers an open question posed by Anily and Haviv [1].","pdfUrls":["http://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~zhang/Reports/seem2008-07.pdf","http://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~zhang/Reports/seem2008-07.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.1110.1000","http://www.menet.umn.edu/~zhangs/Reports/2012_HZZ.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/038f5171b207c83c65a75edb2fdc802f6d26b35b","title":"Polymatroid Optimization, Submodularity, and Joint Replenishment Games","venue":"Operations Research","year":2012}

Is this necessary? This paper addresses this question and investigates the minimum sampling rate needed in order to detect a transient change as efficiently as under full sampling. The problem is cast into a Bayesian setup where the change, assumed to be of fixed known duration n, starts at a time ν that is uniformly distributed within time interval {1, 2,. .. , A n = 2 αn } for some known parameter α > 0. It is assumed that observations are i.i.d. P 0 except during the change period where it is i.i.d. P 1. It is shown that, for any fixed α ∈ (0, D(P 1 ||P 0)), where D(P 1 ||P 0) denotes the relative entropy between P 1 and P 0 , as long as the sampling rate is of order ω(1/n) the change can be detected with the same minimum, linear in n, delay as under full sampling, in the limit of vanishing false-alarm probability as n → ∞. This is achieved by means of a new multi-zoom detection procedure with the following freatures. It agressively rejects and skips samples generated according to P 0 while it sharply increases the sampling rate when a change occurs thereby minimizing detection delay. Conversely, if α > D(P 1 ||P 0) or if the sampling rate is o(1/n) the delay is Θ(A n = 2 αn). This paper illustrates this result through a recently proposed asynchronous communication framework where the receiver observes mostly pure background noise except for a brief period of time, starting at an unknown instant, when data is transmitted thereby inducing transient change in distribution at the receiver. For this model, capacity per unit cost (minimum energy per transmitted bit of information) and communication delay were characterized and shown to be unaffected by a sparse sampling at the receiver as long as the sampling rate is a non-zero constant. This paper strengthens this result and shows that it continues to hold even if the sampling rate is ω(1/B), where B denotes the number of transmitted message bits. Conversely, if the sampling rate decreases as o(1/B), reliable communication is impossible.","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.05930v3.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.05930v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.05930v3.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05930"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0390e6f1a0680e1b169583905fc99030b7ce79c9","title":"Quickest Transient-Change Detection under a Sampling Constraint","venue":"ArXiv","year":2015}

Arts-based approaches are also known to contribute to one's well-being and quality of life. However, much research is required, since the mechanisms by which these non-pharmacological treatments exert their therapeutic and psychosocial effects are not adequately understood. A typical clinical setting utilizing the arts consists of the creation work itself, such as the artwork, as well as the therapist and the patient, all of which constitute a rich and dynamic environment of occurrences. The underlying complex, simultaneous and interwoven processes of this setting are often considered intractable to human observers, and as a consequence are usually interpreted subjectively and described verbally, which affect their subsequent analyses and understanding. We introduce a computational research method for elucidating and analyzing emergent expressive and social behaviors, aiming to understand how arts-based approaches operate. Our methodology, which centers on the visual language of Statecharts and tools for its execution, enables rigorous qualitative and quantitative tracking, analysis and documentation of the underlying creation and interaction processes. Also, it enables one to carry out exploratory, hypotheses-generating and knowledge discovery investigations, which are empirical-based. Furthermore, we illustrate our method's use in a proof-of-principle study, applying it to a real-world artwork investigation with human participants. We explore individual and collective emergent behaviors impacted by diverse drawing tasks, yielding significant gender and age hypotheses, which may account for variation factors in response to art use. We also discuss how to gear our research method to systematic and mechanistic investigations, as we wish to provide a broad empirical evidence for the uptake of arts-based approaches, also aiming to ameliorate their use in clinical settings.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/7a/5e/pone.0126467.PMC4489499.pdf","http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dharel/papers/Paradigm%20for%20Artwork.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0391dca8171f52015eba4fb0e4be3be071950fc9","title":"Computational Paradigm to Elucidate the Effects of Arts-Based Approaches and Interventions: Individual and Collective Emerging Behaviors in Artwork Construction","venue":"PloS one","year":2015}

However, the proliferation rate of Müller glia has been reported to be low in the mammalian retina. To overcome this problem, growth factors and morphogens have been studied as potent promoters of Müller glial proliferation, but the molecular mechanisms that limit the proliferation of Müller glia in the mammalian retina remain unknown. In the present study, we found that the degree of damage-induced Müller glia proliferation varies across mouse strains. In mouse line 129×1/SvJ (129), there was a significantly larger proliferative response compared with that observed in C57BL/6 (B6) after photoreceptor cell death. Treatment with a Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor enhanced the proliferation of Müller glia in 129 but not in B6 mouse retinas. We therefore focused on the different gene expression patterns during retinal degeneration between B6 and 129. Expression levels of Cyclin D1 and Nestin correlated with the degree of Müller glial proliferation. A comparison of genome-wide gene expression between B6 and 129 showed that distinct sets of genes were upregulated in the retinas after damage, including immune response genes and chromatin remodeling factors.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/039e8b768195035f1063f5ae963b4b82b78d3ed4","title":"Proliferation Potential of Müller Glia after Retinal Damage Varies between Mouse Strains","venue":"PloS one","year":2014}

This research has been pioneered by NeuroSynth, a database collecting both brain activation coordinates and associated text across a large cohort of neuroimaging research papers. One of the fundamental aspects of such meta-analysis is text-mining. To date, word counts and more sophisticated methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation have been proposed. In this work we present an unsupervised study of the NeuroSynth text corpus using Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs). The use of DBMs yields several advantages over the aforementioned methods, principal among which is the fact that it yields both word and document embed-dings in a high-dimensional vector space. Such embeddings serve to facilitate the use of traditional machine learning techniques on the text corpus. The proposed DBM model is shown to learn embeddings with a clear semantic structure.","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00223v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00223","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PRNI.2016.7552329","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00223v1.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03a0331d091e3d115240cbab683cc2fb472c3842","title":"Text-mining the neurosynth corpus using deep boltzmann machines","venue":"PRNI","year":2016}

This study determined the effect of agricultural practices (dairy farm grasslands and hyacinth bulb fields) on OM degradation by microorganisms and invertebrates with a consumption and food preference experiment in the field and in the laboratory using natural OM collected from the field. Freshly cut grass and hyacinths were also offered to control for OM composition and large- and small mesh-sizes were used to distinguish microbial decomposition and invertebrate consumption. Results show that OM decomposition by microorganisms and consumption by invertebrates was similar throughout the study area, but that OM collected from ditches adjacent grasslands and freshly cut grass and hyacinths were preferred over OM collected from ditches adjacent to a hyacinth bulb field. In the case of OM collected from ditches adjacent hyacinth bulb fields, both microbial decomposition and invertebrate consumption were strongly retarded, likely resulting from sorption and accumulation of pesticides. This outcome illustrates that differences in agricultural practices can, in addition to direct detrimental effects on aquatic organisms, indirectly alter the functioning of adjacent aquatic ecosystems.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03a0a54d71542d18f1b86fe6424e2c59d8ad7faf","title":"Effects of agricultural practices on organic matter degradation in ditches","venue":"Scientific reports","year":2016}

Among primary tissues, fetal liver cells and brain had detectable levels of c-mpl message, and among primary tumors, none were found to express c-mpl. These data support the conclusion that c-mpl has restricted expression that is primarily, but not exclusively, related to megakaryocytopoiesis.

The subjects participated in a laboratory stress experiment with timed provocations. At fixed intervals, 22 samples of blood were drawn from each subject and frozen for later peptide analyses. Levels of gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and somatostatin were measured by radioimmunoassay. Peptide levels were studied during a friendly greeting, a stress interview, and a food stimulation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean hormone values did not differ between the groups. Smokers had lower mean CCK than nonsmokers. Patients with a high degree of dyspeptic symptoms during the week preceding the experiment had a higher mean somatostatin level than patients with a low degree of dyspeptic symptoms. Heartburn correlated positively with the mean somatostatin level. Mean gastrin correlated with body mass index. During the 15-minute stress interview, significant changes in peptide variations were noted: Gastrin increased in both patient and control group subjects. CCK levels increased in patients from 7.2 pmol/l (6.0-8.5) to 9.8 pmol/l (8.2-11.4), but not in control subjects (p < 0.04, two-way interaction). Somatostatin increased significantly earlier in patients than in the control subjects during the stress interview.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA positive relationship was found between the mean level of somatostatin and the degree of dyspeptic symptoms.

The expression of c-fos mRNA in the rat hypothalamus was examined by in situ hybridization following systemic administration of cholecystokinin (CCK), a procedure known to activate magnocellular oxytocin neurons but not magnocellular vasopressin neurones. 2. Conscious male rats were given a single I.P. injection of 50 micrograms/kg CCK, c-fos mRNA signal was apparent in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in rats killed 10 min after injection but not in uninjected or saline-(vehicle) injected rats. The density of c-fos mRNA at both sites was further elevated in rats killed 30 min or 60 min following injection, and was absent in rats killed 4 h after injection. 3. In the paraventricular nucleus the most dense expression of c-fos mRNA following CCK administration was in the medial, mainly parvocellular portion of the nucleus, in an area corresponding to the distribution of corticotrophin-releasing factor mRNA determined by in situ hybridization in adjacent sections. 4. The I.P. injection of CCK increased plasma oxytocin concentrations, measured by specific radioimmunoassay from 13 +/- 5 pg/ml in control rats to 107 +/- 9 pg/ml in the rats killed 10 min after injection, a similar response to that observed previously in urethane-anaesthetized rats. 5. In each of six urethane-anaesthetized rats, recordings were made from single neurones in the supraoptic nucleus, identified antidronomically as projecting to the posterior pituitary and identified electrophysiologically as putative oxytocin neurones. Following I.P. injection of 50 micrograms/kg CCK, the neurones increased their firing rate by a mean of 1.3 +/- 0.2 spikes/s averaged over the 10 min following injection. 6. From the appearance of c-fos mRNA in supraoptic neurones following CCK administration we conclude that this message is expressed in magnocellular oxytocin neurones, since vasopressin neuronal activity and vasopressin release is known to be unaffected by this stimulus, and since the supraoptic nucleus contains essentially only oxytocin neurones and vasopressin neurones. 7. We conclude that c-fos mRNA expression can be induced in supraoptic oxytocin neurones following brief and modest episodes of electrical activation, suggesting that c-fos may be involved in the gene regulation of these neurones under physiological conditions.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03a61002e65748a1d504e476ab08c439c5e9b152","title":"Electrical activation and c-fos mRNA expression in rat neurosecretory neurones after systemic administration of cholecystokinin.","venue":"The Journal of physiology","year":1991}

The dependence of the transition temperature T(N) and the zero-temperature average spin on the interaction constants is investigated.

For LaFeAsO, we obtain a reasonable estimation of the coupling interactions with the experimental transition temperature T(N) = 138 K. Our results also show that a non-zero antiferromagnetic (AFM) inter-layer coupling is essential for the existence of a non-zero T(N), and the many-body AFM fluctuations reduce substantially the low-temperature magnetic moment per Fe towards the experimental value.

We present a new, more constructive proof of von Neumann's Min-Max Theorem for two-player zero-sum game — specifically, an algorithm that builds a near-optimal mixed strategy for the second player from several best-responses of the second player to mixed strategies of the first player. The algorithm extends previous work of Freund and Schapire (Games and Economic Behavior '99) with the advantage that the algorithm runs in poly(n) time even when a pure strategy for the first player is a distribution chosen from a set of distributions over {0, 1} n. This extension enables a number of additional applications in cryptography and complexity theory, often yielding uniform security versions of results that were previously only proved for nonuniform security (due to use of the non-constructive Min-Max Theorem). We describe several applications, including a more modular and improved uniform version of Impagliazzo's Hardcore Theorem (FOCS '95), showing impossibility of constructing succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARGs) via black-box reductions under uniform hardness assumptions (using techniques from Gentry and Wichs (STOC '11) for the nonuniform setting), and efficiently simulating high entropy distributions within any sufficiently nice convex set (extending a result of Trevisan, Tulsiani and Vadhan (CCC '09)).","pdfUrls":["https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12561351/A%20Uniform%20Min-Max%20Theorem.pdf?sequence=1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40041-4_6","http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/437","http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2013/101","https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/437.pdf","http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/437.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03acbaf736b7db5a2dda1fc6679640b810a97f14","title":"A Uniform Min-Max Theorem with Applications in Cryptography","venue":"IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive","year":2013}

The HindIII, YAP Y chromosome variants, previously shown to influence blood pressure, lipid traits or height, as well as SNPs defining main Y chromosome haplogroups, were typed in 3026, 2783 and 2652 samples, respectively. In addition, 4 subgroups (N~100 each) representing extremes of LDL concentration or blood pressure (BP) were typed for a panel of 17 STRs. The HindIII and YAP polymorphism were not associated with any of the studied traits. Analysis of the haplogroup distribution showed an association between higher HDL level and hg I-M170 (P = 0.02), higher LDL level and hg F*(xI-M170, J2-M172, K-M9) (P = 0.03) and lower BMI and hg N3-Tat (P = 0.04).

While a neglected area of study in schizophrenia, a bimanual movement task may provide a means of assessing the functional integrity of the motor circuit. Twelve patients with chronic schizophrenia and 12 matched control participants performed a bimanual movement task on a set of vertically mounted cranks at different speeds (1 and 2 Hz) and phase relationships. Participants performed in-phase movements (hands separated by 0 degrees ) and out-of-phase movements (hands separated by 180 degrees ) at both speeds with an external cue on or off. All participants performed the in-phase movements well, irrespective of speed or cueing conditions. Patients with schizophrenia were unable to perform the out-of-phase movements, particularly at the faster speed, reverting instead to the in-phase movement. There was no effect of external cueing on any of the movement conditions. These results suggest a specific problem of bimanual coordination indicative of SMA dysfunction per se and/or faulty callosal integration.

The beauty premium, however, disappears when we provide information on individual contributions, and becomes a beauty penalty. Players seem to expect beautiful people to be more cooperative. Relative to these expectations, they appear more selfish, which in turn results in less cooperation by others. These appear to be clear examples of stereotyping.

Sex, dental status prior to radiotherapy, tumor site, bone surgery during tumor resection, concomitant chemotherapy, and the development of advanced ORN were documented for each patient. ORN was classified as grade 3, 4, or 5 according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer classification or grade 3 or 4 according to the late effects in normal tissues/subjective, objective, management, and analytic scale. The cumulative incidence of ORN was estimated. Cox regression analysis was used to identify prognostic risk factors for the development of ORN.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-one patients developed advanced ORN (relative frequency 6.6 %, cumulative incidence 12.4 %). The highest risk was found in patients who had undergone primary bone surgery during tumor resection (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.87; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3.09-11.19) and in patients with tumors located in the oral cavity (HR = 4.69; 95 % CI: 1.33-16.52). Sex, dentition (dentulous vs. edentulous), and chemotherapy had no clinically relevant influence.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nIn contrast to most previous studies, we noted a low cumulative incidence of advanced ORN. Patients with tumors located in the oral cavity and those who undergo bone surgery during tumor resection prior to RT may be considered a high-risk group for the development of ORN.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03b483356e622c94a3f9066ec63533fc7c8ef300","title":"Potential risk factors for jaw osteoradionecrosis after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer","venue":"Radiation oncology","year":2016}

Information from two rocket beacons and four ground receivers yielded multiple samples of E-region horizontal and vertical variations. The radio beacon measurements were made at four sites (Uchinoura, Tarumizu, Tanegashima, Takazaki) in Japan for two rockets (S310-31 and S310-32) launched by the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science (ISAS). Analysis was completed for four sets of beacon data to provide electron density images of sporadic-E layers. Signals from the two-frequency beacons on the SEEK-2 rockets were processed to yield total electron content (TEC) data that was converted into electron density measurements. Wide variations in layer structures were detected. These included horizontal sporadic-E variations, vertical profiles of double, single, and weak layers. The radio beacon measurements were shown to be in agreement with the in-situ SEEK-2 sensors. The first tomographic image of a sporadic-E layer was produced from the data. The rocket beacon technique was shown to be an excellent tool to study sporadic-E layers because absolute TEC accuracy of 0.01 TEC Units can be easily obtained and, with proper receiver placement, electron density images can be produced using computerized ionospheric tomography with better than 1 km horizontal and vertical resolution .","pdfUrls":["http://www.ann-geophys.net/23/2357/2005/angeo-23-2357-2005.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03b4aff375b40c2521c3e6aaae08b38cb83f9f31","title":"Radio Tomographic Imaging of Sporadic-e Layers during Seek-2 Part of Special Issue \" Seek-2 (sporadic-e Experiment over Kyushu 2) \"","venue":"","year":2005}

Hyperpolarization-activated K(+) currents in GH(3) cells bathed in high-K(+) Ca(2+)-free solution were studied to determine the effect of risperidone and other related compounds on the inwardly rectifying K(+) current (I(K(IR))). Risperidone (0.1-10 microM) suppressed the amplitude of I(K(IR)) in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC(50) value for the risperidone-induced inhibition of I(K(IR)) was 1 microM. Risperidone (3 microM) was found to slow the rate of activation. An increase in current deactivation by the presence of risperidone was also observed. Haloperidol (10 microM) and thioridazine (10 microM) inhibited the amplitude of I(K(IR)) effectively, and clozapine slightly suppressed it; however, metoclopramide (10 microM) had no effect on it. Risperidone (10 microM) had no effect on voltage-dependent K(+) and L-type Ca(2+) currents. However, in the inside-out configuration, risperidone (10 microM) did not alter the single-channel conductance, but reduced the activity of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK(Ca)) channels. Under the current-clamp mode, risperidone (3 microM) depolarized the membrane potential and increased the firing rate. With the aid of the spectral analysis, cells that exhibited an irregular firing pattern were also converted to those displaying a regular firing pattern after addition of risperidone (3 microM). The present study provides evidence that risperidone, in addition to the blockade of dopamine receptors, can produce a depressant effect on I(K(IR)) and BK(Ca) channels, and implies that the blockade of these ionic currents by risperidone may affect membrane excitability and prolactin secretion in GH(3) cells.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03b7de9c69f74a993c1f5d55a46e80459f85d4d6","title":"Characterization of inhibition by risperidone of the inwardly rectifying K(+) current in pituitary GH(3) cells.","venue":"Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","year":2000}

By a well-known theorem of Alexander [1], any oriented link in R 3 is isotopic to the closure of a braid. The question when two braids represent isotopic links is answered by Markov's theorem [5] (see [3], [2], or [6] for proofs): It is so if and only if one can pass from one braid to another by conjugations in braid groups B n , the transformations M −1 n called posi-tive/negative Markov moves or stabilizations, and their inverses (destabilizations). In the seminal paper [2] Bennequin established, among other very important results, the analogue of the Alexander theorem for transversal links. Namely, any transversal link is transversally isotopic to the closure of a braid. The purpose of this paper is to prove the corresponding analogue of Markov's theorem. Theorem. Two braids represent transversally isotopic links if and only if one can pass from one braid to another by conjugations in braid groups, positive Markov moves, and their inverses. Let us recall the standard definitions (see e.g. [2]). Consider the 1-form α = dz + x dy − y dx in R 3 with coordinates x, y, z. It defines the standard contact structure in R 3. In the cylindric coordinates r, θ, z with x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ one has α = dz + r 2 dθ. A link L in R 3 is transversal if the restriction α| L does not vanish. In this case α| L defines a canonical orientation on L. A geometric braid in R 3 is an oriented link L such that the restriction dθ| L is positive. In particular, L is disjoint from the z-axis Oz. The degree of L, also called the number of strings of L, is the degree of the projection (r, θ, z) → θ restricted to L. There is a canonical one-to-one correspondence between isotopy classes of geometric braids of degree n and conjugacy classes in the braid group B n. Any conjugacy class in B n defines a transversal isotopy class of transversal links. Indeed, any braid b ∈ B n can be realized as a geometric braid sufficiently C 1-close to the standard circle r = 1, z …","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0112207v1.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03b85d29dd7126b0d44e2644f48cff64386b022d","title":"Markov Theorem for Transversal Links","venue":"","year":2009}

Here, we propose to use this method to predict protein regions involved in the binding of nucleic acids. We have used the OB-fold, a motif known to promote protein-nucleic acid interactions, to validate our approach.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe have tested the method using this well-characterized nucleic acid binding family. Protein regions consensually involved in statistically significant dynamics-based alignments were found to correlate with nucleic acid binding regions. The validated scheme was next used as a tool to predict which regions of the AXH-domain representatives (a sub-family of the OB-fold for which no DNA/RNA complex is yet available) are putatively involved in binding nucleic acids. The method, therefore, is a promising general approach for predicting functional regions in protein families on the basis of comparative large-scale dynamics.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe software is available upon request from the authors, free of charge for academic users.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp339"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03b8b4c5276b04b63d943013870fe63ff8501e44","title":"Using dynamics-based comparisons to predict nucleic acid binding sites in proteins: an application to OB-fold domains","venue":"Bioinformatics","year":2009}

In this work, a novel index at the profile level is presented, namely, the profile domain linker propensity index (PDLI), which uses the evolutionary information of profiles for domain linker prediction. The frequency profiles are directly calculated from the multiple sequence alignments outputted by PSI-BLAST and converted into binary profiles with a probability threshold. PDLI is then obtained by the frequencies of binary profiles in domain linkers as compared to those in domains. A smooth and normalized numeric profile is generated for any amino acid sequences from which the domain linkers can be predicted. Testing on the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database and CASP6 targets shows that PDLI outperforms other indexes at the amino acid level.","pdfUrls":["http://www.iipl.fudan.edu.cn/staff/dongqw/papers/7.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2006.01.001"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03b8c9428a7bea1e38e9488e7d930aec0d172cae","title":"Domain boundary prediction based on profile domain linker propensity index","venue":"Computational Biology and Chemistry","year":2006}

Using case mix-adjusted zero-inflated Poisson regression, IDP patients were significantly less likely to receive an antibiotic (adjusted OR=0.25 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.84), p=0.03) and received shorter courses (adjusted rate ratio (RR)=0.71 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.93), p=0.01). Clinically stable IDP patients of uncertain diagnosis were more likely to have antibiotics held (87% vs 55%; p=0.02). There was no significant difference in treatment failure or mortality (adjusted p>0.5; also in the 3-year data set), but IDP patients were more likely to be admitted overnight (adjusted OR=3.53 (95% CI 1.24 to 10.03), p=0.03) and have longer length of stay (adjusted RR=1.19 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.36), p=0.007).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe IDP-led group used 30% less antibiotic therapy with no adverse clinical outcome, suggesting antibiotic use can be reduced safely in the acute setting. This may be achieved in part by holding antibiotics and admitting the patient for observation rather than prescribing, which has implications for costs and hospital occupancy. More information is needed to indicate whether any such longer admission will increase or decrease risk of antibiotic-resistant infections.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03b913df71a704264f06a2f985e0abb914ecf638","title":"Antibiotic use and clinical outcomes in the acute setting under management by an infectious diseases acute physician versus other clinical teams: a cohort study","venue":"BMJ open","year":2016}

caused an estimated 5.7 million deaths in 2005, and 87% of these deaths were in low-income and middle-income countries. Without intervention, the number of global deaths is projected to rise to 6.5 million in 2015 and to 7.8 million in 2030. The rising burden of stroke, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, leads us to propose a worldwide goal for stroke: a 2% reduction each year over and above that which may happen as a result of better case management and treatment. The experience of high-income countries indicates that sustained interventions can achieve at least the required 4% annual average decline in stroke mortality for people age 60-69 years. Achieving this goal for stroke would result in 6.4 million fewer deaths from stroke from 2005 to 2015. More of these deaths will be averted in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03bfc70d55027da5e62814101d11d6f192d63915","title":"Preventing stroke: saving lives around the world.","venue":"The Lancet.

In literature, few VVF cases have been managed by laparoendoscopic single site surgery (LESS) and for the 1(st) time we report VVF repair by LESS using conventional laparoscopic instruments. We present our initial experience and to assess its feasibility, safety and outcome.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nFrom March 2012 to September 2015, LESS VVF repair was done for ten patients aged between 30 and 65 (45.6 ± 10.15) years, who presented with supratrigonal VVF. LESS was performed by modified O'Conor technique using regular trocars with conventional instruments. Data were collected regarding feasibility, intra- or post-operative pain, analgesic requirement, complication, and recovery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll 10 cases were completed successfully, without conversion to a standard laparoscopic or open approach. The mean operative time was 182.5 ± 32.25 (150-250) min. The mean blood loss was 100 mL. The respective mean visual analog score for pain on day 1, 2, and 3 was 9.2 ± 1, 5 ± 1, and 1.4 ± 2.3. The analgesic requirement in the form of intravenous tramadol on days 1, 2, and 3 was 160 ± 51.6, 80 ± 63.2, and 30 ± 48.3, mgs respectively. No major intra- or post-operative complications were observed. The mean hospital stay was 2.6 ± 0.7 (2-4) days.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn select patients, LESS extravesical repair of VVF using conventional laparoscopic instruments is safe, feasible with all the advantages of single port surgery at no added cost. Additional experience and comparative studies with conventional laparoscopy are warranted.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03c0dad1a0ce5afb366ee8d89fa6008d74999e58","title":"Laparoendoscopic single site surgery for extravesical repair of vesicovaginal fistula using conventional instruments: Our initial experience","venue":"Urology annals","year":2016}

In this paper, a mathematical model of the lower urinary tract it is proposed as a preliminary study to better understand its functioning. Furthermore, another goal of that mathematical model proposal is to provide a basis for developing artificial control systems. Lower urinary tract is comprised of two interacting systems: the mechanical system and the neural regulator. The latter has the function of controlling the mechanical system to perform the voiding process. The results of the tests reproduce experimental data with high degree of accuracy. Also, these results indicate that simulations not only with healthy patients but also of patients with dysfunctions with neurological etiology present urodynamic curves very similar to those obtained in clinical studies.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2012.09.005"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03c17ccc7df633e7bd92d9f32f8b871a293a5290","title":"Mathematical modelling of the lower urinary tract","venue":"Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","year":2013}

MAS schemes were compared with schemes where selection is directly on the QTL (GAS or gene assisted selection) and with schemes where genotype information is not considered (PHE or phenotypic selection). A methodology for including prior information on the QTL effect in the genetic evaluation is presented and the benefits from MAS were investigated when prior information was used. The optimisation of the genetic contributions has a great impact on genetic response but the use of markers leads to only moderate extra short-term gains. Optimised PHE did as well as standard truncation GAS (i.e. with fixed contributions) in the short-term and better in the long-term. The maximum accumulated benefit from MAS over PHE was, at the most, half of the maximum benefit achieved from GAS, even with very low recombination rates between the markers and the QTL. However, the use of prior information about the QTL effects can substantially increase genetic gain, and, when the accuracy of the priors is high enough, the responses from MAS are practically as high as those obtained with direct selection on the QTL.","pdfUrls":["http://www.gsejournal.org/content/pdf/1297-9686-34-6-679.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/47/4f/Genet_Sel_Evol_2002_Nov_15_34(6)_679-703.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03c3bcebf21ce01221f2965482d81e871a935cad","title":"Marker assisted selection with optimised contributions of the candidates to selection","venue":"Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE","year":2002}

However, the effects of changes in PaCO2 on cerebral arterial compliance (Ca) are unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe assessed the changes in Ca in 20 normal subjects using monitoring of arterial blood pressure (ABP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV). Cerebral arterial blood volume (CaBV) was extracted from CBFV. Ca was defined as the ratio between the pulse amplitudes of CaBV (AMPCaBV ) and ABP (AMPABP). All parameters were recorded during normo-, hyper-, and hypocapnia.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring hypocapnia, Ca was significantly lower than during normocapnia (.10±.04 vs. .17±.06; P<.001) secondary to a decrease in AMPCaBV (1.3±.4 vs. 1.9±.5; P<.001) and a concomitant increase in AMPABP (13.8±3.4 vs. 11.6±1.7 mmHg; P<.001). During hypercapnia, there was no change in Ca compared with normocapnia. Ca was inversely correlated with the cerebrovascular resistance during hypo- (R2=0.86; P<.001), and hypercapnia (R2=0.61; P<.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nUsing a new mathematical model, we have described a reduction of Ca during hypocapnia. Further studies are needed to determine whether Ca may be an independent predictor of outcome in pathological conditions.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03c4e46fdb90c49cf24365dd590e5740f9e06608","title":"Effect of hyper- and hypocapnia on cerebral arterial compliance in normal subjects.","venue":"Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging","year":2011}

To date, performance evaluation of NoC designs is largely based on simulation which, besides being extremely slow, provides little insight on how different design parameters affect the actual network performance. Therefore, it is practically impossible to use simulation for optimization purposes. In this paper, we first present a generalized router model and then utilize this novel model for doing NoC performance analysis. The proposed model can be used not only to obtain fast and accurate performance estimates, but also to guide the NoC design process within an optimization loop. The accuracy of our approach and its practical use is illustrated through extensive simulation results.","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1266366.1266602","http://www.gm.ece.cmu.edu/~sld/pubs/papers/07f_3_768.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03c6fba3f3feaa3ad683d5aaff7af4ea0a75bbc5","title":"Analytical router modeling for networks-on-chip performance analysis","venue":"DATE","year":2007}

This can be formulated as the problem of minimizing the abscissa (maximum of the real parts of the roots) of a polynomial whose coefficients depend linearly on the controller parameters. We show that the only order for which there is a non-trivial solution is 2. In this case, we derive a controller that we prove locally maximizes the asymptotic decay rate, using recently developed techniques from nonsmooth analysis. We consider the system shown in Figure 1 consisting of two masses interconnected by a spring, a typical control benchmark problem which is a generic model of a system with a rigid body mode and one vibration mode [10]. If the first mass is pulled sufficiently far apart from the second mass and suddenly dropped, then the two masses will oscillate until they reach their equilibrium position. The control problem we study in this note consists of appropriately moving the second mass so that the first mass settles down to its final position as fast as possible; more specifically, we want to maximize the asymptotic decay rate.

Long-term measurement of muscle denervation and loco-motor behavior in individual wild-type and ALS model mice. increasing number of mouse models of human degenerative and injury-related diseases that affect motor behavior raises the importance of in vivo methodologies allowing measurement of physiological and behavioral changes over an extended period of time in individual animals. A method that provides long-term measurements of muscle denervation and its behavioral consequences in individual mice for several months is presented in this article. The method is applied to mSod1 G93A mice, which model human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The denervation process of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles in mSod1 G93A mice is demonstrated for up to 3 mo. The data suggest that as muscle denervation progresses, massive behavioral compensation occurs within the spinal cord that allows animals to walk almost normally until late ages. Only around the age of 84 days is the first sign of abnormal movement during walking behavior detected as an abnormal tibialis anterior activity profile that is manifested in subtle but abnormal swing movement during walking. Additionally, this method can be used with other mouse models of human diseases, such as spinal cord injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, Parkinson's diseases, and spinal muscular atrophy. THE MOUSE HAS BECOME THE STANDARD model for research aiming to understand the mechanisms of human diseases. This fact is fueled by the availability of diverse mouse models for injuries, such as spinal cord injury and intracerebral hemorrhage (Rynkowski et al. 2008; Steward et al. 1999), and mutant mouse lines modeling human degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's diseases, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; Ebadi et al. 2005; Wong et al. 2002). The availability of these invaluable models of human diseases raises the importance of in vivo methodologies allowing the measurement of physiological and behavioral changes that occur over extended time periods in individual animals. This article demonstrates a method that can be used to measure muscle denervation and its behavioral consequences in individual mice for up to 3 mo, which is essential for research aiming to understand disease progression in degenerative diseases, such as ALS. ALS is a human disease with adult onset where motor neurons (MNs) die progressively, leading to paralysis and, in most cases, death (Kanning et al. 2010). Considerable knowledge regarding ALS disease progression has been gained by using an array of methods to study ALS mouse models.

Subcellular fractionation of bovine neurointermediate pituitary shows that this enzyme is present in the peptide-containing secretory vesicles. The enzyme has been purified 2,800-fold from whole bovine pituitaries using ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Purified dynorphin-converting enzyme has a neutral pH optimum, and is subsantially inhibited by the thiol-protease inhibitor p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid, but not by serine or metalloprotease inhibitors. The purified enzyme processes dynorphin B-29 at Arg14, producing both dynorphin B-14 and dynorphin B-13 in a 5:1 ratio. No other cleavages are observed, suggesting that the activity is free from other proteases and is specific for single Arg sequences. Purified enzyme also processes dynorphin A-17 at the single Arg cleavage site, generating both dynorphin A-8 and A-9 in a 7:1 ratio.

The proposed sequence is theoretically proved to enjoy several nice properties including constant amplitude, zero autocorrelation, and orthog-onality in multipath channels. Moreover, the analytical results show that the proposed sequence can greatly reduce the multi-cell interference (MCI) induced by carrier frequency offset (CFO) to a negligible level. Therefore, the CFO estimation algorithms designed for single-user or single-cell environments can be slightly modified, and applied in multi-cell environments; an example is given for showing how to modify the estimation algorithms. Consequently, the computational complexity can be dramatically reduced.

Beyond the improvements in DOA estimation, it will be shown the advantages of using the VSA in bottom parameters estimation.

Simulation results for the DS CDMA systems utilizing 32-chip modified Walsh-Hadamard sequences and are presented and compared to those achieved in the case of system utilizing pure 32-chip Walsh-Hadamard sequences. 1. Introduction Walsh-Hadamard bipolar spreading sequences are generally used for channel separation in direct sequence code division multiple access (DS CDMA) systems, e.g. [1]. They are easy to generate, and orthogonal [2] in the case of perfect synchronization. However, the crosscorrelation between two Walsh-Hadamard sequences can rise considerably in magnitude if there is a non-zero delay shift between them. Unfortunately, this is very often the case for up-link (mobile to base station) transmission, due to the differences in the corresponding propagation delays. As a result, significant multi-access interference (MAI) [3] occurs which needs to be combated either by complicated multiuser detection algorithms [4], or a reduction in bandwidth utilization. We propose here a simple modification to Walsh-Hadamard spreading sequences, which improves their properties in asynchronous applications. Such modified sequences are still orthogonal, but can exhibit much lower peaks in the aperiodic crosscorrelation functions and out-of-phase aperiodic autocorrelation functions. Hence, the level of MAI can be significantly reduced, if they are applied in DS CDMA systems for up-link transmission. Moreover they are characterized with much lower values of out-of-phase aperiodic autocorrelation. Hence, the use of such modified sequences can facilitate a sequence acquisition process [5].

Lessons from four-decade investigations of the epidemiology, immunology, pathogenesis, prevention and therapy of perinatal infectious agents, which invade directly the nervous system, have led us to propose a new indirect effect hypothesis: maternal transplacentally-acquired antibodies, to agents with epitope molecular mimicry with the developing nervous system, can cross the fetus/infant's blood-nervous system barriers to cause NMD's, clinically manifest years later. Further rationale is provided by relevant evolutionary/developmental (EVO-DEVO) considerations - applicable also to some vaccines. The hypothesis is being tested in: (a) older pregnancy studies with available maternal and newborn sera, and follow-up of the progeny for NMD's; and (b) NMD registry individuals linked to their stored newborn blood spots. Preliminary results support a possible role for schizophrenia of high-tittered antibodies to some agents (toxoplasma, influenza and herpes simplex type 2 virus). A model that includes likely genetic and postnatal influences is schematized and a list of putative agents and factors, based on varying rationales, is tabulated. In case pilot studies are confirmed, the identified agent(s) and antibodies would need to be tested in new prospectively enrolled pregnant women, so as to establish further risk factors leading to possible preventive modalities.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/e0/ad/Clin_Dev_Immunol_2006_Jun-Dec_13(2-4)_167-183.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03dd0feee4c125bdcf555ec6613631b15f260404","title":"The Possible Role of Transplacentally-Acquired Antibodies to Infectious Agents, With Molecular Mimicry to Nervous System Sialic Acid Epitopes, as Causes of Neuromental Disorders: Prevention and Vaccine Implications","venue":"Clinical & developmental immunology","year":2006}

Hence, the selection of stimulation parameters is full of challenges. Additionally, due to the complexity of neural system, together with omnipresent noises, the accurate model of thalamic relay neuron is unknown. Thus, the iterative learning control of the thalamic relay neuron's Parkinsonian state based on various variables is presented. Combining the iterative learning control with typical proportional–integral control algorithm, a novel and efficient control strategy is proposed, which does not require any particular knowledge on the detailed physiological characteristics of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop and can automatically adjust the stimulation parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control strategy to restore the fidelity of thalamic relay in the Parkinsonian condition. Furthermore , through changing the important parameter—the maximum ionic conductance densities of low-threshold calcium current, the dominant characteristic of the proposed method which is independent of the accurate model can be further verified. The basal ganglia (BG) is a set of small subcortical nervous system nuclei, including the striatum, the internal segment of the globuspallidus (GPi), the external segment of the globuspallidus (GPe), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and substantian-igra, which is further separated in pars compacta (SNc) and pars reticula (SNr). The primary 'input' components of the BG are the striatum and STN, which can receive the neural information from the cerebral cortex. Moreover, GPi and SNr are the main 'output' nuclei of the BG, projecting to frontal cortex via the thalamus [1–3]. Numerous experiments have demonstrated that there is evidence linking the BG to an extensive range of processes, including perception [4], mental task [5], learning [6], etc. Simultaneously, dysfunction of the BG is associated with the movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's chorea [7]. PD is a neurodegenerative disease that can gradually destroy the dopaminergic neurons in the SNc [8,9]. This dopaminer-gic deficiency leads to a cascade of functional changes in BG system, which is ultimately responsible for the development of the cardinal features of PD [10,11]. The neurological manifestations of PD include four key signs: tremor, rigidity (stiffness), bradykinesia (slowness of movement) and postural instability [12].

Studies of branching mutants in herbaceous plants have identified several key genes involved in strigolactone biosynthesis or signaling. The strigolactone signal is perceived by a member of the α/β-fold hydrolase superfamily, known as DWARF14 (D14). However, little is known about D14 genes in the woody perennial plants. Here we report the identification of D14 homologs in the model woody plant Populus trichocarpa. We showed that there are two D14 homologs in P. trichocarpa, designated as PtD14a and PtD14b that are over 95% similar at the amino acid level. Expression analysis indicated that the transcript level of PtD14a is generally more abundant than that of PtD14b. However, only PtD14a was able to complement Arabidopsis d14 mutants, suggesting that PtD14a is the functional D14 ortholog. Amino acid alignment and structural modeling revealed substitutions of several highly conserved amino acids in the PtD14b protein including a phenylalanine near the catalytic triad of D14 proteins. This study lays a foundation for further characterization of strigolactone pathway and its functions in the woody perennial plants.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/51/71/srep21593.PMC4753501.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03e33ba1c5ae063f1a93c18fae84e0e6d86e97a7","title":"Characterization of DWARF14 Genes in Populus.","venue":"Scientific reports","year":2016}

The SIP Roland scale and the other SIP scales demonstrated similar sensitivity to changes associated with multidisciplinary inpatient treatment for chronic pain. Finally, the pattern of relationships between the SIP Roland scale and several pain-related measures supported the concurrent validity of the SIP Roland scale.

External application of 50 microM S1P elicited a long-lasting oscillatory current that continued over 30 min from the beginning of oscillation, with 300 nA (n = 11) as a usual maximum peak of current, whereas 1-microM LPA treatment showed only transiently oscillating but more vigorous current responses, with 2,800 nA (n = 18) as a maximum peak amplitude. Both phospholipid-induced Ca2+-dependent Cl- currents were observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, were blocked by intracellular injection of the Ca2+ chelator, EGTA, and could not be elicited by treatment with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ ATPase. Intracellular Ca2+ release appeared to be from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive Ca2+ store, because Cl- currents were blocked by heparin injection. Pretreatment with the aminosteroid, U-73122, an inhibitor of G protein-mediated phospholipase C (PLC) activation, to oocytes inhibited the current responses evoked both by S1P and LPA. However, when they were injected with 10 ng of antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ODN) against Xenopus phospholipase C (PLC-xbeta), oocytes could not respond to S1P application, whereas they responded normally to LPA, indicating that the S1P signaling pathway goes through PLC-xbeta, whereas LPA signaling goes through another unknown PLC. To determine the types of G proteins involved, we introduced AS-ODNs against four types of G-protein alpha subunits that were identified in Xenopus laevis; G(q)alpha, G11alpha, G0alpha, and G(i1)alpha. Among AS-ODNs against the G alphas tested, AS-G(q)alpha and AS-G(i1)alpha to S1P and AS-G(q)alpha and AS-G11alpha to LPA specifically reduced current responses, respectively, to about 20-30% of controls. These results demonstrate that LPA and S1P, although they have similar structural features, release intracellular Ca2+ from the IP3-sensitive pool, use different components in their signal transduction pathways in Xenopus oocytes.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03e45170be15243f796dda60f9e361a4ca863c96","title":"Different signaling pathway between sphingosine-1-phosphate and lysophosphatidic acid in Xenopus oocytes: functional coupling of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor to PLC-xbeta in Xenopus oocytes.","venue":"Journal of cellular physiology","year":1998}

The disease is characterized in affected girls by a latent appearance of symptoms between 12 and 18 months of age while boys usually die before the age of two. The nature of the latency is not known, but RTT-like phenotypes are recapitulated in mouse models, even when MeCP2 is removed at different postnatal stages, including juvenile and adolescent stages. Unexpectedly, here, we show that within a very brief developmental window, between 10 (adolescent) and 15 (adult) weeks after birth, symptom initiation and progression upon removal of MeCP2 in male mice transitions from 3 to 4 months to only several days, followed by lethality. We further show that this accelerated development of RTT phenotype and lethality occur at the transition to adult stage (15 weeks of age) and persists thereafter. Importantly, within this abbreviated time frame of days, the brain acquires dramatic anatomical, cellular and molecular abnormalities, typical of classical RTT. This study reveals a new postnatal developmental stage, which coincides with full-brain maturation, where the structure/function of the brain is extremely sensitive to levels of MeCP2 and loss of MeCP2 leads to precipitous collapse of the neuronal networks and incompatibility with life within days.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03ec3d730f47791a21fa6bf3ff3f5662b0615c39","title":"Acute and crucial requirement for MeCP2 function upon transition from early to late adult stages of brain maturation.","venue":"Human molecular genetics","year":2016}

It is reported here that permeation across the sodium channel is voltage- and concentration-dependently reduced by Mgi2+. This results in a general reduction of sodium membrane conductance and an outward sodium peak current at large positive potentials. 30 mM Mgi2+ leads ot a negative shift of voltage dependence of sodium channel gating parameters, probably due to the surface potential change of the membrane. This shift alone is, however, insufficient to explain the reduction of outward sodium currents. The blockage by Mgi2+ is decreased upon increasing intracellular or extracellular Na+ concentration, which suggests that Mgi2+ interferes with sodium permeation by competitively occupying sodium channels. Using a kinetic model to describe the sodium permeation, the dissociation constant (at zero membrane potential) of Mgi2+ for the sodium channel has been calculated to be 8.65 +/- 1.51 mM, with its binding site located at 0.26 +/- 0.05 electrical distance from the inner membrane.

Evidence of such deficits may contribute to our understanding of the interpersonal difficulties in cannabis-users, and the link between cannabis-use and psychological disorders (Moore et al., 2007).\n\n\nMETHOD\nEmotion recognition performance of heavy cannabis-users and non-using controls was compared. A measure of emotion recognition was used in which participants identified facial expressions as they changed from neutral (open-mouth) to gradually more intense expressions of sadness, neutral, anger or happiness (open or closed mouth). Reaction times and accuracy were recorded as the facial expressions changed. Participants also completed measures of 'theory of mind,' depression and impulsivity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCannabis-users were significantly slower than controls at identifying all three emotional expressions. There was no difference between groups in identifying facial expressions changing from open-mouth neutral expressions to closed-mouth neutral expressions suggesting that differences in emotion recognition were not due to a general slowing of reaction times. Cannabis-users were also significantly more liberal in their response criterion for recognising sadness.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHeavy cannabis-use may be associated with affect recognition deficits. In particular, a greater intensity of emotion expression was required before identification of positive and negative emotions. This was found using stimuli which simulated dynamic changes in emotion expression, and in turn, suggests that cannabis-users may experience generalised problems in decoding basic emotions during social interactions. The implications of these findings are discussed for vulnerability to psychological and interpersonal difficulties in cannabis-users.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03f445d432fa23b4c5098d9b2048f289abe69067","title":"Processing dynamic facial affect in frequent cannabis-users: evidence of deficits in the speed of identifying emotional expressions.","venue":"Drug and alcohol dependence","year":2010}

Most species distribution models (SDMs) require or prefer species presence and absence data for adequate estimation of model parameters. However, observations with unreliable or unreported species absences dominate and limit the implementation of SDMs. Presence-only models generally yield less accurate predictions of species distribution, and make it difficult to incorporate spatial autocorrelation. The availability of large amounts of historical presence records for freshwater fishes of the United States provides an opportunity for deriving reliable absences from data reported as presence-only, when sampling was predominantly community-based. In this study, we used boosted regression trees (BRT), logistic regression, and MaxEnt models to assess the performance of a historical metacommunity database with inferred absences, for modeling fish distributions, investigating the effect of model choice and data properties thereby. With models of the distribution of 76 native, non-game fish species of varied traits and rarity attributes in four river basins across the United States, we show that model accuracy depends on data quality (e.g., sample size, location precision), species' rarity, statistical modeling technique, and consideration of spatial autocorrelation. The cross-validation area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) tended to be high in the spatial presence-absence models at the highest level of resolution for species with large geographic ranges and small local populations. Prevalence affected training but not validation AUC. The key habitat predictors identified and the fish-habitat relationships evaluated through partial dependence plots corroborated most previous studies. The community-based SDM framework broadens our capability to model species distributions by innovatively removing the constraint of lack of species absence data, thus providing a robust prediction of distribution for stream fishes in other regions where historical data exist, and for other taxa (e.g., benthic macroinvertebrates, birds) usually observed by community-based sampling designs.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03f59182d1894ec377ff0ea20f1a084f900f0aaf","title":"Using Historical Atlas Data to Develop High-Resolution Distribution Models of Freshwater Fishes","venue":"PloS one","year":2015}

High-resolution bowel ultrasound has emerged as an alternative imaging technique for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with CD, being as accurate as CT and MR for detecting intramural and extramural extension of the disease. B-Mode US can evaluate the localization and length of the affected intestinal segments and allow identification of transmural complications , stenosis and intestinal obstruction. Doppler techniques are tools that visualize and quantify bowel vascularization. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a new technique that involves IV administration of an ultrasound contrast agent with real-time examination, providing an accurate depiction of the bowel wall micro-vascularization and the perienteric tissues. The introduction of imaging quantification techniques enables an objective quantitative measurement of the enhancement. Method and results The article reviews the technique, sonographic findings, advantages and limitations, and clinical applications of contrast-enhanced US in the evaluation of Cohn's disease. Current CEUS applications in CD are: CD activity assessment, evaluation of inflam-matory masses, distinguishing phlegmons from abscesses, characterization of stenosis by differentiating fibrosis from inflammation, monitoring the efficacy of drug treatments and improving the detection of disease recurrence.

A ganglion cell, located centrally over the bipolar electrode configuration was selected to extracellularly record action potentials during stimulation. To analyse the recorded action potentials, we introduce a new method which combines the advantages of (a) singular value decomposition (SVD) for weighting similar modulation patterns with which the recorded action potentials are characterized and (b) multi curve fitting to identify a common threshold level, required to finally assemble a strength-duration relationship (SDR). By directly comparing the obtained SDR curves, we found that the efficiency of stimulation with the monopolar electrode configuration is significantly higher than with the bipolar electrode configuration. All obtained SDR curves were fitted using the Lapicque model to estimate the chronaxie times and the rheobase currents. Liquid inclusions, eventually separating the retina from the electrodes are discussed to be a major cause for low ganglion cell responses during stimulation with the bipolar electrode configuration.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03f74d2a8da61e61b1a70d0e7839b9b3a5272f58","title":"Monopolar vs. bipolar subretinal stimulation-an in vitro study.","venue":"Journal of neuroscience methods","year":2011}

Hereby, we were able to detect a specific interaction between S100A11 and Rad54B, which could be confirmed under in vivo conditions. Rad54B, a DNA-dependent ATPase, is described to be involved in recombinational repair of DNA damage, including DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Treatment with bleomycin, which induces DSBs, revealed an increase in the degree of colocalization between S100A11 and Rad54B. Furthermore, S100A11/Rad54B foci are spatially associated with sites of DNA DSB repair. Furthermore, while the expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) was increased in parallel with DNA damage, its protein level was drastically down-regulated in damaged cells after S100A11 knockdown. Down-regulation of S100A11 by RNA interference also abolished Rad54B targeting to DSBs. Additionally, S100A11 down-regulated HaCaT cells showed a restricted proliferation capacity and an increase of the apoptotic cell fraction. These observations suggest that S100A11 targets Rad54B to sites of DNA DSB repair sites and identify a novel function for S100A11 in p21-based regulation of cell cycle.","pdfUrls":["http://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1418&context=open_access_pubs"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03f956b390aea4f69d49acc4f0faa82434754269","title":"Rad54B targeting to DNA double-strand break repair sites requires complex formation with S100A11.","venue":"Molecular biology of the cell","year":2008}

INTRODUCTION Scientific computing is credited for many of the technological breakthroughs of our generation. It is used in fields ranging from drug discovery, aerospace, weather prediction to seismic analysis and many others. Scientific computation often deals with very large amounts of data and its algorithms need to compute results from mathematical models. Due to its compute and data intensive nature, these applications are often parallel, i.e. they perform calculations simultaneously on multiple computers. The TOP500 list [2] ranks the top supercomputing sites across the world. Recently, top systems have crossed the Petaflop (10 15 floating point operations) barrier. It is expected that Exaflop (10 18) levels will be reached by the turn of the decade. This fast growth in the HPC field is being sustained by the low costs that are afforded by commodity components. Commodity components include general purpose processors from Intel, AMD, and IBM; GPGPUs from NVIDIA etc.; I/O buses such as PCI express and interconnection networks such as InfiniBand. As machines grow ever larger and more powerful, the entire networking stack and application stack needs to evolve. An underlying design principle in HPC is to expose, not hide, system features that lead to better performance. However, as system complexity grows, this must be done in a manner that does not overwhelm application developers with detail. In order to keep scaling applications on increasingly more powerful systems, it is imperative to explore new architectures from system point of view and new programming paradigms from application point of view. In this article we explore the co-design approach to taking advanced features from commodity network such as InfiniBand, incorporating the design into a state-of-the-art MPI communication library and finally modifying the applications to leverage these new features.","pdfUrls":["http://nowlab.cse.ohio-state.edu/publications/journal-papers/2011/sur-computer11-article.pdf","http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/static/media/publications/abstract/sur-computer11-article.pdf","http://nowlab.cse.ohio-state.edu/static/media/publications/abstract/sur-computer11-article.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03faf497036ee0e1a600cfd0c16f027294a8fe5b","title":"Co-designing Mpi Library and Applications for Infiniband Clusters","venue":"","year":2011}

It covers many active research fields, such as evolutionary computation, neural computation, molecular computation , quantum computation, ecological computation, etc. It has made tremendous progress in recent years in academic research and real-world applications. Many university departments have been offering individual modules/courses in one form or another on related topics. However, few universities have been offering an entire postgraduate program in natural computation. This article sum-marises one such MSc program in Nat-first launched in the 2001/02 academic year after one year preparation and timely funding from UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The key motivation behind this program is to provide an integrated postgraduate program in natural computation to computer science and engineering graduates who will be able to learn different natural computation techniques in a unified framework. The program is designed to be industry-oriented and research-led. This 12-month Program consists of six taught modules, two mini-projects and one summer project. Among the six taught modules, the three introductory modules, i.e., Introduction to Evolutionary Computation, Introduction to Neural Computation and Introduction to Quantum and Molecular Computation, are designed to lay a solid foundation for the four major areas within natural computation. In addition to these three taught modules in the first term, the students will do their first mini-project, which consists of a research skill component and a mini-research project. The idea behind the mini-research project, supervised by an academic staff, is to engage students in carrying out literature review, problem formulation, feasibility study and producing preliminary results. The mini-project serves as a precursor to the summer project , for which students are expected to have done the ground work and produce a substantial piece of research work. Inspired Learning and Nature Inspired Design, are organized very differently from other modules.

This renders them an inevitable component to realize the paradigm of intuitive human-machine interaction. Our demonstration shows model-based recognition of facial expressions in real-time via the state-of-the-art Candide-3 face model [1] as visible in Figure 1. This three-dimensional and deformable model is highly appropriate for real-world face interpretation applications. However, its complexity challenges the task of model fitting and we tackle this challenge with an algorithm that has been automatically learned from a large set of images. This solution provides both, high accuracy and runtime. Note, that our system is not limited to facial expression estimation. Gaze direction, gender and age are also estimated. Models reduce the large amount of image data to a small number of model parameters to describe the image content, which facilitates and accelerates the subsequent interpretation task. Cootes et al. [3] introduced modelling shapes with Active Contours. Further enhancements emerged the idea of expanding shape models with texture information [2]. Recent research considers modelling faces in 3D space [1, 10]. Fitting the face model is the computational challenge of finding the parameters that best describe the face within a given image. This task is often addressed by minimizing an objective function, such as the pixel error between the model's rendered surface and the underlying image content. This section describes the four main components of model-based techniques, see [9]. The face model contains a parameter vector p that represents its configurations. We integrate the complex and de-formable 3D wire frame Candide-3 face model [1]. The model consists of 116 anatomical landmarks and its param-The localization algorithm computes an initial estimate of the model parameters that is further refined by the subsequent fitting algorithm. Our system integrates the approach of [8], which detects the model's affine transformation in case the image shows a frontal view face. The objective function yields a comparable value that specifies how accurately a parameterized model matches an image. Traditional approaches manually specify the objective function in a laborious and erroneous task. In contrast, we automatically learn the objective function from a large set of training data based on objective information theoretic measures [9]. This approach does not require expert knowledge and it …","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813440","http://ias.cs.tum.edu/_media/spezial/bib/mayer08arealtime.pdf","http://ias.in.tum.de/_media/spezial/bib/mayer08arealtime.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/03fc466fdbc8a2efb6e3046fcc80e7cb7e86dc20","title":"A real time system for model-based interpretation of the dynamics of facial expressions","venue":"FG","year":2008}

Why is the free neutron unstable outside the atom? This paper applies the cordus conjecture to address these questions. The proposed explanation is that in the nucleus the discrete field structures (cordus HED) of the proton and neutron fulfil each other, thereby providing a joint stability. When the neutron is removed from the nucleus, its stability becomes compromised. By comparison the single proton on its own does not need the neutron, so it remains stable. The free neutron is able to maintain a dynamic stability by moving its field structures around. It can do this indefinitely. However it is in a compromised state, and vulnerable to perturbation by external fields. Two initiators are anticipated for decay. One is randomly occurring field fluctuations from the external fabric, and these are proposed for the conventional decay route. The second is impact by another particule. In both cases it is the external fields that cause the decay, by constraining the neutron so that it cannot dynamically adjust. Hence it is trapped in a state that leads to decay at its next frequency cycle. The second path could involve any particule with sufficient energy to disturb the neutron. Also, the impact of a neutrino is specifically identified as a potential initiator of decay. The implications if this is correct, are that the neutron has two separate decay paths, which are mixed together in what we perceive as the beta minus process. The first is determined by the local density of the (spacetime) fabric, and the second by the number of energetic particules and neutrinos encountered. The significance of the two decay paths is that neutron decay rates are predicted to be variable rather than constant. A general set of assumptions are extracted for stability and decay of particules in general. 1 Introduction The standard concept in physics is that fundamental particles (electron, photon, etc.) are zero dimensional (0D) points without internal structure. In contrast the cordus conjecture [1] suggests that it is more helpful, in terms of explanatory power, to conceive of a two-ended internal structure. This cordus particule model has been used to create a conceptual model of the discrete field structures of the neutrino and antineutrino [2].

In the present study, we examined the roles of the dopamine D1 and D2 receptor subtypes in the regulation of corticosteroid receptors.

By social resonance, we mean the state of being that pertains when individuals engaged in face-to-face communication feel strongly connected. The studies we will present elaborate and extend a wealth of findings, primarily from social psychology and anthropology, on a set of closely related concepts; e.g., 'interpersonal sensitivity' (Hall & Bernieri, 2001), 'social glue' (Lakin, et al., 2003), 'interactional synchrony' (Bernieri & Rosenthal, 1991), empathy (Sonnby-Borgstrom, et al. 2003, Nishio, 2002), and 'socially distributed cognition' (DuBois, 2000). In choosing the term SOCIAL RESONANCE, we seek to emphasize the dyad or group as a focal level of analysis and theory. Resonance also evokes the dynamic interplay of behaviors, multi-modally, between participants in real time interactions. The social psychological notion of 'rapport,' as well as recent-era reformulations of anthropologist Malinowki's (1923) construct, 'phatic communion,' resemble the sense of social resonance we employ here: \" … all the different communicative strands, speech, gesture, posture, body movements, orientation, proximity, eye contact, and facial expressions … woven together to form the fabric of conversation, \" (Laver, 1975). Social resonance has been the focus of research across quite a range of scientific disciplines. Its presence in interaction is ascertained on the basis of behavioral observables that occur singly and in clusters, or in patterns of alternation or sequential unfolding across an interval of interaction. Examples include mimicry or 'mirroring' of various nonverbal behaviors, interactional rhythm in conversation, and syntactic priming. The work presented here takes up where many social psychological and anthropological treatments of resonance phenomena leave off, by examining its impact on real-time cognitive processing; specifically, on processes of language production and comprehension. Our studies illuminate, through close analysis of the multi-modal (speech and gesture) aspects of human interaction, what psycholinguistic processing mechanisms may be triggered by, facilitated by-or, conversely-remain inactive, or even be inhibited by, respectively, presence or absence of social resonance. Kimbara and Parrill present recent work on the interaction between gestural mirroring (specifically, cases in which a speaker appears unconsciously to adjust her use of gesture space, in accord with her interlocutor's use of space, to create matching nonverbal expression of spatial layouts) and 'structural priming' (Bock, 1986), or, the ways in which one speaker's choice of syntactic construction influences the subsequent choice of construction on the part of her interlocutor.

When imaging shifted to axial CT, \"eee\" phonation was used to delineate mucosal anatomy better. However, because patients could not phonate for the entire examination (which could take several minutes), the technique was only useful during supplemental imaging, performed after the primary acquisition through the neck. The supplemental images covered a limited area (usually the larynx or supraglottis) and, therefore, could be obtained while patients phonated. Imaging of the neck has now shifted to multidetector CT (MDCT). With a 64-detector MDCT, the entire neck can be imaged in 8 seconds.

First, performance on tests of verbal memory fluctuates in concert with physiological changes in ovarian hormone production during the menstrual cycle and during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Estrogen therapy (ET) prevents the decrease in verbal memory when administered immediately following the surgical removal of both ovaries in premenopausal women. Some, but relatively little evidence is available to support the idea that ET, initiated at the time of a natural or a surgical menopause for a few years, may protect against cognitive decline 30 years later and more research in this area is urgently needed. Finally, the evidence to date strongly suggests that the initiation of ET decades after the menopause has occurred does not protect against cognitive decline or dementia. Taken together, these findings support the so-called \"window of opportunity\" hypothesis which holds that ET will be neuroprotective only when administered closely in time to a natural or surgical menopause.","pdfUrls":["http://gormanlab.ucsd.edu/courses//files/psy132/SherwinCognition.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/040d8d90b1c2902eeb2cb196b0c4597965408481","title":"Estrogen and cognitive functioning in women: lessons we have learned.","venue":"Behavioral neuroscience","year":2012}

Open systems are seen as coordinators (i.e. terms with place-holders), that evolve when suitable components (i.e. closed terms) fill in their place-holders. The distinguishing feature of our approach is the definition of a symbolic operational semantics for coordinators that exploits spatial/modal formulae as labels of transitions and avoids the universal closure of coordinators w.r.t. all components. Two kinds of bisimilarities are then defined, called strict and large, which differ in the way formulae are compared. Strict bisimilarity implies large bisimilarity which, in turn, implies the one based on universal closure. Moreover, for process calculi in suitable formats, we show how the symbolic semantics can be defined constructively, using unification. Our approach is illustrated on a toy process calculus with CCS-like communication within ambients.","pdfUrls":["http://www.di.unipi.it/~bruni/publications/amast2002.pdf.gz","http://www.dsi.unive.it/myths/reports/papers/bisim-by-unif-amast02.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45719-4_18","http://www.math.unipd.it/~baldan/Papers/Soft-copy-pdf/amast02.pdf","http://www.di.unipi.it/~braccia/DATA/MY_PAPERS/AMAST_02.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/040f7601871411432972e3e5950af057efd865c0","title":"Bisimulation by Unification","venue":"AMAST","year":2002}

We carried out a retrieval of studies that investigated associations between COMT Val158Met polymorphism and PD risk in Asians, and included the study if it met the eligibility criteria. Stata version 12.0 was used to analyze the data. A total of 13 studies including 1,834 patients and 2,298 controls were included. The overall result indicated that COMT Val158Met polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of PD in Asians (AA vs others: OR = 1.58, 95 % CI 1.26-1.97, p < 0.001; GG vs AA: OR = 0.63, 95 % CI 0.47-0.85, p = 0.002; AA vs GA: OR = 1.58, 95 % CI 1.24-2.00, p < 0.001).

In this study we describe a yeast based approach which allows the identification of mutations within the HBD of steroid receptors, in this case the estrogen receptor, which result in altered specificity of the HBD with respect to its activation by ligands. Using this approach in yeast, we identified an estrogen receptor (HBD) mutant (His524 to Gln) whose activation by 17 beta-estradiol (E2) is significantly reduced while activation by a diphenol indene-ol compound (GR132706X) is increased, compared to the wild type estrogen receptor. When the activity of the mutant receptor was tested in mammalian cells the altered specificity was maintained. A chimeric transcription factor was constructed, in which the mutated estrogen receptor HBD was linked to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and an 11 amino acid transcriptional activation domain of RelA. Reporter gene activation by this chimera was decreased in response to E2 and increased in response to GR132706X, as compared to the corresponding chimeric transcription factor containing the wild type estrogen receptor HBD. This approach should allow the development of a steroid receptor HBD based regulator of gene expression, whose activity is controlled specifically by a synthetic ligand, that would not affect the activity of endogenous steroid receptors.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/041438335f84d3cb9f098d8a8a4d3cef3f0368f2","title":"Generation of estrogen receptor mutants with altered ligand specificity for use in establishing a regulatable gene expression system.","venue":"The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology","year":1996}

While deletion or duplication of MBD5 may contribute to a genetic predisposition to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, or epilepsy, the impact of rare MBD5 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on neurodevelopmental features, particularly features with late onset, has not been fully explored. In this study, we conducted exon-targeted resequencing of MBD5 with next-generation sequencing technology in 562 Japanese patients (192 with idiopathic ASD and 370 with schizophrenia (SCZ)) and detected 16 MBD5 SNVs with allele frequencies of ≤1%. We then performed phenotype analyses with 12 novel variants of these 16 SNVs. SCZ patients with these variants exhibited mainly within normal development ranges until the first psychosis and ASD patients with SNVs did not precisely overlap with the core characteristics described in previous literature as being associated with MBD5 SNVs.

A deficiency of this enzyme has been reported in some human leukemias and lymphomas and in a few solid tumors. In the present study, a specific immunoassay was used to assess the enzyme levels in human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and primary tumors. We also tested the effects of MeSAdo phospho-rylase-selective chemotherapy on the in vitro growth of enzyme-positive and enzyme-negative lung cancer cell lines. Of 29 non-small cell lung cancers, 9 (6 cell lines and 3 primary tumors, 31%) lacked detectable immunoreactive enzyme protein. Both 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate, an inhibitor Â«dirnovo purine synthesis, and methionine depletion, combined with MeSAdo, prevented the growth of the enzyme-negative non-small cell lung cancer cells under conditions in which enzyme-positive cells utilized MeSAdo to endogenously synthesize purine nucleotides and methionine. Our data suggest that MeSAdo phosphorylase deficiency is frequently found in non-small cell lung cancers and can be exploited in designing enzyme-selective chemotherapy.","pdfUrls":["http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/53/5/1098.full.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0414b1a029403bc0f029a7bc805697ce220679a7","title":"Non-small Cell Lung Cancers Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase Deficiency in Human Updated Version Citing Articles E-mail Alerts Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase Deficiency in Human Non-small Cell Lung Cancers1","venue":"","year":1991}

However, implementing self-timed combinational logic is complex and expensive. In particular, mapping large function blocks into cell-libraries is difficult as decomposing gates introduces new signals which may violate indication. This paper presents a novel method for implementing any m-of-n encoded function block using \" bounded gates \" , where any gate may be decomposed without violating indication. This is achieved by successively decomposing the input encoding into smaller m-of-n codes. The method described in the paper uses algebraic extraction techniques to efficiently determine and quantify potential re-encodings. The results of the synthesis procedure are demonstrated on a range of combi-national function blocks.","pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ASYNC.2010.12","http://www.minatec.org/nocs2010/Presentations/ASYNC2010%20-%20A1%20-%20Will%20Toms%20-%20MofN%20Code%20Decomposition.pdf","http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ftp/pub/amulet/papers/Toms_Async10.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0415089acff518534835a1e921663a45c1820e1e","title":"M-of-N Code Decomposition for Indicating Combinational Logic","venue":"ASYNC","year":2010}

Although trans-translation is not essential in several bacterial species, it has been found essential for viability or virulence in a wide range of pathogens. We describe here that trans-translation is essential in the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila, the etiologic agent of Legionnaire's disease (LD), a severe form of nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia. The ssrA gene coding for tmRNA, the key component of trans-translation, could not be deleted in L. pneumophila. To circumvent this and analyse the consequences of impaired trans-translation, we placed ssrA under the control of a chemical inducer. Phenotypes associated with the inhibition of ssrA expression include growth arrest in rich medium, hampered cell division, and hindered ability to infect eukaryotic cells (amoebae and human macrophages). LD is often associated with failure of antibiotic treatment and death (>10% of clinical cases). Decreasing tmRNA levels led to significantly higher sensitivity to ribosome-targeting antibiotics, including to erythromycin. We also detected a higher sensitivity to the transcription inhibitor rifampicin. Both antibiotics are recommended treatments for LD. Thus, interfering with trans-translation may not only halt the infection, but could also potentiate the recommended therapeutic treatments of LD.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0415f7e05945495c2faae3ba73998115b19a4d3e","title":"Trans-translation is essential in the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila","venue":"Scientific reports","year":2016}

Recently, various drugs have been reported to be useful in the treatment of CJD; however, for such treatments to be useful it is essential to rapidly and accurately diagnose CJD. 124 CJD patients and 87 with other diseases causing rapid progressive dementia were examined. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) from CJD patients was analyzed by 2D-PAGE and the protein expression pattern was compared with that from healthy subjects. One of three CJD-specific spots was found to be fatty acid binding protein (FABP), and heart-type FABP (H-FABP) was analyzed as a new biochemical marker for CJD. H-FABP ELISA results were compared between CJD patients and patients with other diseases (n = 211). Visual readout accuracy of the Rapicheck(®) H-FABP test panel for CSF was analyzed using an independent measure of CSF H-FABP concentration. The distribution of H-FABP in the brains of CJD patients was examined by immunohistochemistry. ELISA sensitivity and specificity were 90.3% and 92.9%, respectively, and Rapicheck(®) H-FABP sensitivity and specificity were 87.9% and 96.0%, respectively. ELISA and Rapicheck(®) H-FABP assays provided comparable results for 14-3-3 protein and total tau protein. Elevated H-FABP levels were associated with an accumulation of abnormal prion protein, astrocytic gliosis, and neuronal loss in the cerebral cortices of CJD patients. In conclusion, Rapicheck(®) H-FABP of CSF specimens enabled quick and frequent diagnosis of CJD. H-FABP represents a new biomarker for CJD distinct from 14-3-3 protein and total tau protein.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/041b06adc34a1ae58a67c21981a9d8da2c4a9d1d","title":"Development of an ultra-rapid diagnostic method based on heart-type fatty acid binding protein levels in the CSF of CJD patients.","venue":"Cellular and molecular neurobiology","year":2010}

The morphology, abundance and distribution of antennal sensilla in both sexes of this pest were examined. We found that the antennae of A. mali females were longer than those of males. Five types of antennal sensilla were characterized, including trichodea (subtypes Tr.1, Tr.2, and Tr.3), chaetica (subtypes Sc.1, Sc.2, Sc.3, and Sc.4), basiconica (subtypes Ba. 1, Ba. 2, Ba. 3 and Ba.4), Böhm bristles (subtypes BB. 1, and BB. 2), and multiporous grooved sensilla. The most abundant sensilla of Ba.2 tended to occur mainly on flagellomeres 5-8 in both sexes. The last three flagellomeres tended to have the most abundant Tr.1 in both sexes. Overall, the abundance and distribution of these sensilla appeared to be highly conserved in both sexes, and their olfactory organs seemed to cluster on flagellomeres 6-8. However, some sex dimorphisms were also observed. Tr.3 and BB.2 were found only in females. Sensilla of Sc.2 were found on the pedicel and first two flagellomeres only in males. When compared with males, females showed a higher number of Sc.3, but a lower number of Sc.4 on the pedicel. These results indicate that contact cues could be important in intersexual communication in A. mali. The functional roles of these sensilla and their implications in A. mali behaviors are discussed, and further studies of identified chemosensitive sensilla can provide a foundation for developing semiochemical-based management strategies.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/041c726e2e73215ae5ef3b1f1f12cd0765726c6a","title":"Morphology and Ultrastructure of Antennal Sensilla in Male and Female Agrilus mali (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)","venue":"Journal of insect science","year":2016}

Children selective attention for complicated visual stimuli has been investigated from different perspectives, within the most important are found the studies of the In this context it is interesting to analyze how social factors can effect the formation of visual objects recognition in young school children. The objective of the present work was to characterize the kind of responses in situation of visual selective attention and decision making in urban and rural 1 st grade elementary school children aged 6-7. Methods The subjects of this study were 60 children aged 6-7 from urban (n = 30: 16 boys, 14 girls) and rural (n=30: 16 boys, 14 girls) public schools without a history of pronounced neurological disease. Selective visual recognition was estimated by use of hierarchical letters paradigm (Navon, 1977). The \" Hierarchical letter test \" consisted of two series. Tree variants of stimuli were used: congruent, incongruent and neutral. During every series 20 stimuli of each type were presented. In the first series (global) the children were asked to identify the big letter (global aspect). In this series we used a big \" E \" (6.4 x 2.4 angular degree) made up of smaller \" E \" 's or an \" H \" made up of smaller \" H \" 's) as congruent stimuli, a big \" E \" made up of smaller \" H \" 's or an \" H \" made up of smaller \" E \" 's as incongruent stimuli. And big a \" E \" and an \" H \" made up of \" O \" s as a neutral stimuli. In the second series (local) of the test the child had to identify the local aspect of the hierarchical letter. For this part we used the same stimuli except the neutral ones. Here we used big a \" O \" made up of \" E \" 's or \" H \" 's as neutral stmuli. Characteristics of responses-reaction time and response accuracy (correct or incorrect) were analyzed. Responses were registered and those long (more than 1500 ms) were eliminated, as well as those short (less than 100ms). Responses data were processed by Word Excel (Microsoft, Windows Office, 2003) and were averaged individually. The averaged data were statistically processed by RM ANOVA and nonparametric procedures (Friedman Test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test) …","pdfUrls":["http://conf.msu.ru/archive/Lomonosov_2007/16/Gilberto_GA.pdf","http://www.psy.msu.ru/science/conference/lomonosov/2007/thesis/Gilberto_GA.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0426140f425dd58d8dc12778038ca6c689dae603","title":"Comparative Study of Selective Visual Objects Recognition in Urban and Rural 6-7-year-old Children","venue":"","year":2007}

Arabidopsis and rice, although now completely sequenced and under intensive comparative genomic investigation, are separated by at least 125 million years of evolutionary time, and cannot in isolation provide a comprehensive perspective on structural and functional aspects of flowering plant genome dynamics. Here we discuss new genomic resources available to the scientific community, comprising cDNA libraries and Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequences for a suite of phylogenetically basal angiosperms specifically selected to bridge the evolutionary gaps between model plants and provide insights into gene content and genome structure in the earliest flowering plants.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRandom sequencing of cDNAs from representatives of phylogenetically important eudicot, non-grass monocot, and gymnosperm lineages has so far (as of 12/1/04) generated 70,514 ESTs and 48,170 assembled unigenes. Efficient sorting of EST sequences into putative gene families based on whole Arabidopsis/rice proteome comparison has permitted ready identification of cDNA clones for finished sequencing. Preliminarily, (i) proportions of functional categories among sequenced floral genes seem representative of the entire Arabidopsis transcriptome, (ii) many known floral gene homologues have been captured, and (iii) phylogenetic analyses of ESTs are providing new insights into the process of gene family evolution in relation to the origin and diversification of the angiosperms.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nInitial comparisons illustrate the utility of the EST data sets toward discovery of the basic floral transcriptome. These first findings also afford the opportunity to address a number of conspicuous evolutionary genomic questions, including reproductive organ transcriptome overlap between angiosperms and gymnosperms, genome-wide duplication history, lineage-specific gene duplication and functional divergence, and analyses of adaptive molecular evolution. Since not all genes in the floral transcriptome will be associated with flowering, these EST resources will also be of interest to plant scientists working on other functions, such as photosynthesis, signal transduction, and metabolic pathways.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/8b/e8/BMC_Plant_Biol_2005_Mar_30_5_5.tar.gz","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/8b/e8/1471-2229-5-5.PMC1083416.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/042744951b0f0d0b7a29a725e1c37fa35984a7d9","title":"Floral gene resources from basal angiosperms for comparative genomics research","venue":"BMC plant biology","year":2005}

Alternative entrances could facilitate diffusion of the reaction products or at least water and ions from the active site. Previous molecular dynamics simulations identified side door and back door as the most probable alternative entrances. The simulations of non-inhibited AChE suggested that the back door opening events occur only rarely (0.8% of the time in the 10ns trajectory). Here we present a molecular dynamics simulation of non-inhibited AChE, where the back door opening appears much more often (14% of the time in the 12ns trajectory) and where the side door opening was observed quite frequently (78% of trajectory time). We also present molecular dynamics, where the back door does not open at all, or where large conformational changes of the AChE omega loop occur together with alternative passage opening events. All these differences in AChE dynamical behavior are caused by different protonation states of two glutamate residues located on bottom of the active site gorge (Glu202 and G450 in Mus musculus AChE). Our results confirm the results of previous molecular dynamics simulations, expand the view and suggest the probable reasons for the overall conformational behavior of AChE omega loop.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/042e8d9f416f071efde03690e2da6ffaa05b7d44","title":"Influence of the acetylcholinesterase active site protonation on omega loop and active site dynamics.","venue":"Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics","year":2010}

Application of the essential dynamics method revealed large, chromophore-linked fluctuations of the protein in the ground state, as well as in a form containing the isomerized chromophore. Various loops become more mobile upon isomerization of the chromophore, including a loop which is part of the PAS domain motif, found in light perception proteins. The hinge points identified in these fluctuations correlate with the positions of evolutionary conserved glycines. The results derived from the simulations directly correlate with available experimental data, provide a framework for understanding the dynamic behaviour of the yellow protein and give clues to subsequent steps in the signal transduction pathway.","pdfUrls":["http://davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/pdf/pypmd.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0430fc3e0fb5fbcec21bb4af3db9f688401872b1","title":"Concerted motions in the photoactive yellow protein.","venue":"Protein engineering","year":1998}

During superfusion of the slices, stimulation by nicotinic agonists for 2 min only slightly increased [3H]NA outflow in the rat neocortex, but caused a tetrodotoxin-sensitive. Ca(2+)-dependent release of [3H]NA in rat hippocampus and human neocortex. In both tissues a similar rank order of potency of nicotinic agonists was found: epibatidine >> DMPP > nicotine approximately cytisine > or = acetylcholine; choline was ineffective. In human neocortex, the effects of nicotine (100 microM) were reduced by mecamylamine, methyllycaconitine, di-hydro-beta-erythroidine (10 microM, each) and the alpha3beta2/alpha6betax-selective alpha-conotoxin MII (100/200 nM). The alpha3beta4 selective alpha-conotoxin AuIB (1 microM), and the alpha7 selective alpha-conotoxin ImI (200 nM) as well as alpha-bungarotoxin (125 nM) were ineffective. Glutamate receptor antagonists (300 microM AP-5, 100 microM DNQX) acted inhibitory, suggesting the participation of nAChRs on glutamatergic neurons. On the other hand, nAChR agonists were unable to evoke exocytotic release of [3H]acetylcholine from human and rat neocortical slices preincubated with [3H]choline.\n\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n(1) alpha3beta2 and/or alpha6 containing nAChRs are at least partially responsible for presynaptic cholinergic facilitation of noradrenergic transmission in human neocortex; (2) nicotinic autoreceptors were not detectable in rat and human neocortex.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04316ac7249bf4c443bb876f667c2e5ac4203605","title":"Characterization of nicotinic receptors inducing noradrenaline release and absence of nicotinic autoreceptors in human neocortex.","venue":"Brain research bulletin","year":2004}

While the most widespread tools for querying syntactically annotated corpora tend to focus on single occurrences, one aspect that is not fully exploited yet in this area is that language is a complex system whose units are connected to each other at both microscopic (the single occurrences) and macroscopic level (the whole system itself). Assuming that language is a system, we describe a tool (using the DoubleTreeJS visualization) to visualize the results of querying dependency treebanks by forming a node from a single item type, and building a network in which the heads and the dependents of the central node are respectively the left and the right vertices of the tree, which are connected to the central node by dependency relations. One case study is presented, consisting in the exploitation of DoubleTreeJS for supporting one assumption in theoretical linguistics with evidence provided by the data of a dependency treebank of Medieval Latin.","pdfUrls":["http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/summaries/63.html","http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/pdf/63_Paper.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04366eeb40049e683baa2286a1fbc35b35f17d21","title":"A Compact Interactive Visualization of Dependency Treebank Query Results","venue":"LREC","year":2014}

Electrical stimulation (by way of Interferential Current) applied at the pain area (segmental) was administered to 4 groups of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain. Two groups were administered with noxious stimulation (30% above pain threshold) and two with innocuous stimulation (30% below pain threshold). In each group half of the patients received a fixed current intensity while the other half raised the intensity continuously during treatment whenever fading of sensation was perceived. Group 5 and 6 received sham stimulation and no treatment, respectively. The outcome measures were: chronic pain intensity, morning stiffness, range of motion (ROM), pain threshold and % pain reduction. Both noxious and innocuous stimulation significantly decreased chronic pain (P<0.001) and morning stiffness (P<0.01) and significantly increased pain threshold (P<0.001) and ROM (P<0.001) compared with the control groups. Nevertheless, noxious stimulation decreased pain intensity (P<0.05) and increased pain threshold (P<0.001) significantly more than innocuous stimulation. No differences in treatment outcomes were found between adjusted and unadjusted stimulation.

We investigated the effect of metformin on leptin levels in women with PCOS. Thirty women with PCOS received metformin 500 mg thrice a day. After two months of metformin treatment the mean leptin levels reduced significantly (p < 0.001). Ovulation was achieved in 28 patients, who also had a significant reduction in leptin levels (p < 0.001). Leptin showed significant positive correlation with weight (p < 0.05) and testosterone (p < 0.01), but no significant correlation with insulin. It is concluded that metformin reduces leptin resistance in PCOS women which induces ovulation.

In this study, we examine how these factors affect the construction of passwords on input-constrained devices such as mobile phones. We conducted a between-group experiment with 72 students from the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), in which we asked the participants to construct new passwords using PC keyboards and mobile phones with different keypad layouts. Passwords constructed by using PC keyboards were stronger than those constructed by touchscreen keypads. Surprisingly, passwords that were constructed by mobile phones with physical keyboards were stronger than those constructed by PC keyboards. We also designed a custom layout for the touchscreen keypad that offers a more convenient method of typing digits and some special characters. Our results show that this custom layout helped the participants to construct stronger passwords on mobile phones. To address an alternative explanation for better performance of the physical keyboard and custom layout groups, we designed a second experiment by removing the potential bias effects of the first experiment. The results of this within-group experiment confirm that if users are presented with a more convenient method of entering digits and special characters on mobile handsets, they take advantage of it to construct stronger passwords. The results also supplement our finding regarding password construction and user engagement from the first experiment and highlight an important design consideration about password construction pages for mobile versions of websites.","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2516760.2516767"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0439da8f2a5001907fd7769287ca91a751c68952","title":"Passwords and interfaces: towards creating stronger passwords by using mobile phone handsets","venue":"SPSM@CCS","year":2013}

To fit a DPP to a given task, we would like to learn the entries of its kernel matrix by maximizing the log-likelihood of the available data. However, log-likelihood is non-convex in the entries of the kernel matrix, and this learning problem is conjectured to be NP-hard [1]. Thus, previous work has instead focused on more restricted convex learning settings: learning only a single weight for each row of the kernel matrix [2], or learning weights for a linear combination of DPPs with fixed kernel matrices [3]. In this work we propose a novel algorithm for learning the full kernel matrix. By changing the kernel parameterization from matrix entries to eigen-values and eigenvectors, and then lower-bounding the likelihood in the manner of expectation-maximization algorithms, we obtain an effective optimization procedure. We test our method on a real-world product recommendation task, and achieve relative gains of up to 16.5% in test log-likelihood compared to the naive approach of maximizing likelihood by projected gradient ascent on the entries of the kernel matrix.","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1088.pdf","http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5564-expectation-maximization-for-learning-determinantal-point-processes","http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1088","http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~jengi/nips2014.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1088v1.pdf","http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5564-expectation-maximization-for-learning-determinantal-point-processes.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/043a50d17d2f9a3c9f4af154afdb19a178364867","title":"Expectation-Maximization for Learning Determinantal Point Processes","venue":"NIPS","year":2014}

MBD is known as a hard problem and grows exponentially in the size of the system. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines MBD with multi-label classification. We propose to build a classifier that maps symptoms of the system to possible faults. The major advantage of this approach is by reducing significantly the online computational complexity; The learning process of the relations between the observation and the diagnosis is performed in advance offline, and then online, by using the classifier, we can immediately return the diagnosis. This paper addresses several challenges: 1) modeling the MBD problem as a classification problem, 2) generating informative samples for the training set, 3) verifying sound and minimal diagnosis. 1 INTRODUCTION With the development of technology over the years and the overgrowing use of large scale and complex systems, the problem of tracking and diagnosing faulty components in the system became more difficult. Thus, the need for automated diagnosis is increased. Automated diagnosis is concerned with reasoning about the health of systems, including the identification of abnormal behavior, the isolation of faulty components and the prediction of system behavior under normal and abnormal conditions. Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) is one of the leading artificial intelligence approaches that copes with the diagnosis problem (de Kleer and Williams, 1987). In MBD approach, a model of the system is being built. The diagnoser observes the actual behavior of the system and predicts its behavior by the model. Discrepancies between the observation and the prediction—symptoms—are used as the input for the diagnosis algorithms which produce a set of possible faults that can explain such symptoms.

The system, that is well suited for commercial form retrieval, uses Radon Transform for layout description and Dynamic Time Warping for document image matching. The experimental results, that were conducted using real and simulated data sets, demonstrate the proposed approach is effective and robust with respect to different classes of commercial forms and shifted/rotated document images. Document retrieval is a very a critical task of current document management systems due to the exponential growth of the number of documents available in databases and digital libraries. Traditional document retrieval systems – based on set-theoretic, algebraic and probabilistic models-require a document to be present in text form and the querying method is based on a specific textual content in the document [Doermann, 1998; Manning et al., 2009]. Whatever the model used, text-based document retrieval systems require a document in text form, since the search for similar documents is based on comparing the textual contents. As a consequence, a preliminary stage of image to text conversion by an Optical Character Recognizer (OCR) is required when a document is in image form. OCR is a time-consuming error-prone process, specifically in the case of multi-lingual/multi-font documents and poor-quality document images [Marukawa","pdfUrls":["http://mondodigitale.aicanet.net/2014-1/augmented_reality_e_biometrics/03_PIRLO.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0446912ebccc6b59f160c8596f92b84c69398cc4","title":"A Layout-analysis Based System for Document Image Retrieval! ! !","venue":"","year":2014}

The mice developed obesity, dyslipidemia, fatty liver, diabetes and insulin resistance. These disorders were effectively normalized in baicalein-treated mice. Further investigation revealed that the inhibitory effect on inflammation and insulin resistance was mediated by inhibition of the MAPKs pathway and activation of the IRS1/PI3K/Akt pathway. The lipid-lowering effect was attributed to the blocking of synthesis way mediated by SERBP-1c, PPARγ and the increased fatty acid oxidation. All of these effects depended on AMPKα activation. These results were confirmed in the primary hepatocytes from wild type and AMPKα(2)(-/-) mice. However, the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway showed no change, which may be due to the time of stimulation and concentration. Thus, these data suggested that baicalein protects mice from metabolic syndrome through an AMPKα(2)-dependent mechanism involving multiple intracellular signaling pathways.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0446e3b06e100311267cfa86ade1260e594fdcd6","title":"Baicalein, a natural product, selectively activating AMPKα(2) and ameliorates metabolic disorder in diet-induced mice.","venue":"Molecular and cellular endocrinology","year":2012}

WTEC assessments cover basic research, advanced development, applications, and commercialization. Small panels of about six technical experts conduct WTEC assessments. Panelists are leading authorities in their field, technically active, and knowledgeable about U.S. and foreign research programs. As part of the assessment process, panels visit and carry out extensive discussions with foreign scientists and engineers in universities and in industry and government labs. The ITRI staff at Loyola College helps select topics, recruits expert panelists, arranges study visits to foreign laboratories, organizes workshop presentations, and finally, edits and disseminates the final reports. ABSTRACT This report is a review of two basic research programs funded by the Research Development Corporation of Japan (JRDC). The primary focus of the report is on the Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO) program, as an update of a 1988 JTEC report on the same subject. The current panel found that the ERATO program has been quite successful as a catalyst for changing the Japanese system of supporting and performing research, and that research performed under ERATO is of high quality, with several projects leading to the development of world-class research. At least in one case, an ERATO project created a new scientific field. The panel also concluded that the ERATO process has unique characteristics that can be applied in the United States, particularly in encouraging the development of closer ties between academic, national laboratory, and industrial researchers. The report also briefly reviews a newer JRDC program entitled Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO). Its process and mode of funding are more like traditional U.S. procedures than is the case with ERATO, although its objective is more focused and designed to help researchers embark upon new lines of work. The panel found that, while PRESTO is too new to be fully evaluated, early indications suggest good results. Information sources for this study included a literature review, visits to JRDC-funded laboratories, and interviews with numerous past and present ERATO and PRESTO researchers.

We recently introduced a novel deny-by-default distributed security policy enforcement architecture for MANETs by harnessing and extending the concept of network capabilities. The deny-by-default principle allows compromised nodes to access only authorized services, limiting their ability to disrupt or even interfere with end-to-end connectivity and nodes beyond their local communication radius. The enforcement of policies is done hop-by-hop, in a distributed manner. In this paper, we present the implementation of this architecture, called DIPLOMA, on Linux. Our implementation works at the network layer, and does not require any changes to existing applications. We identify the bottlenecks of the original architecture and propose improvements, including a signature optimization, so that it works well in practice. We present the results of evaluating the architecture in a realistic MANET testbed Orbit. The results show that the architecture incurs minimal overhead in throughput, latency and jitter. We also show that the system protects network bandwidth and the end-hosts in the presence of attackers. To that end, we identify ways of creating multi-hop topologies in indoor environments so that a bad node cannot interfere with every other node. We also show that existing applications are not impacted by the new architecture, achieving good performance.","pdfUrls":["http://www.nsl.cs.columbia.edu/papers/2010/diploma.nss10.pdf","http://nsl.cs.columbia.edu/papers/2010/diploma.nss10.pdf","http://www.cs.columbia.edu/nsl/papers/2010/diploma.nss10.pdf","http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~angelos/Papers/2010/diploma.pdf","http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~angelos/Papers/2010/diploma.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/NSS.2010.27"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/044f7b7eb83806d1624830c68b5f57d6251f7aef","title":"DIPLOMA: Distributed Policy Enforcement Architecture for MANETs","venue":"NSS","year":2010}

Two objectives in mutual contrast i.e. static torque and torque ripple, depending on two design variables, are considered. An innovative procedure for vector optimization which aims at obtaining as many optimal solutions as possible, is presented. To this end, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) is set up, linking Pareto Optima Theory and Genetic Algorithms. This way, fifty different optimal solutions lying on the Pareto optimal front are obtained. This procedure gives the designer a wide set of optimal solution, each of which corresponds to a different degree of preference with respect to the single objectives. Introduction The optimal design of electromagnetic devices and, in particular, of electrostatic micromotors usually is characterized by objectives in mutual contrast, giving rise to a multicriteria optimization problem (Di Barba, 1999). There are two different ways to tackle such a problem. The first one consists of building a single scalar objective function by combining the single objectives in a suitable way. This approach leads to classical multiobjective optimization methods and gives a solution which is supposed to be the optimum. This procedure seems to be highly arbitrary in the choice of both the scalarization criterion and the weighting coefficients implied. The second way to tackle the problem consists of applying the Pareto optima theory (Deb, 1999) linking it to an optimization genetic algorithm (Goldberg, 1989). The result is a family of non-dominated solutions and the procedure does not imply any arbitrary choice.","pdfUrls":["http://www.lania.mx/~ccoello/EMOO/dibarba00.pdf.gz","http://www.jeo.org/emo/dibarba00.pdf.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/045287f6eed6ec0748ba7668533087d683791b14","title":"Vector Shape Optimization of an Electrostatic Micromotor Using a Genetic Algorithm","venue":"","year":2000}

The participants in the experimental group observed the child performing the task between a first and a second estimation, but the participants in the control group did not. In general, the observers were less accurate in estimating the child's maximum step length than in the other tasks. The observation of a single trial was enough to adjust perceivers' estimations, reducing error magnitude to about 50% of the initial error, but only in tasks with a poor first estimation. An absolute error of 5 cm persisted after one-trial observation. The magnitude of the adjustment in the estimation of affordances for others is task-dependent, and is more pronounced in tasks that imply greater action scaling than in tasks that require direct body scaling.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0453b4972f826ec9bbb41607c5553eb03699a954","title":"Perceiving children's affordances: recalibrating estimation following single-trial observation of three different tasks.","venue":"Human movement science","year":2013}

The patients suffer from severe immune defects resulting in increased susceptibility to infections and failure to generate an antitumor immune response. Defects in both, DNA damage response (DDR) pathway and crosstalk with the tissue microenvironment have been reported to play a crucial role for the survival of CLL cells, therapy resistance and impaired immune response. To this end, major advances over the past years have highlighted several T cell immune evasion mechanisms in CLL. Here, we discuss the consequences of an impaired DDR pathway for detection and elimination of CLL cells by natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are considered to be a major component of the immunosurveillance in leukemia but NK cell activity is impaired in CLL. Restoration of NK cell activity using immunoligands and immunoconstructs in combination with the conventional chemotherapy may provide a future perspective for CLL treatment.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/b5/66/fgene-06-00011.PMC4316781.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/045594a1bf93f46a2bf33c43a62290bf73a818b1","title":"DNA damage response and evasion from immunosurveillance in CLL: new options for NK cell-based immunotherapies","venue":"Front.

Although the application of mindfulness appears straightforward and its effectiveness is well supported, the concept may easily be misunderstood. This misunderstanding may severely limit the benefit of mindfulness-based interventions. It is therefore necessary to understand that the characteristics of mindfulness are based on a set of seemingly paradoxical structures. This article discusses the underlying paradox by disentangling it into five dialectical positions - activity vs. passivity, wanting vs. non-wanting, changing vs. non-changing, non-judging vs. non-reacting, and active acceptance vs. passive acceptance, respectively.

Such statements are ubiquitous in daily life and are involved in critical cognitive activities like decision-making and evaluation of alternative outcomes. Here, we investigate the brain mechanisms and the nature of the semantic representations involved in understanding the complex meaning of counterfactual statements. We used fMRI to examine brain responses to counterfactual statements describing actions of high and low physical effort and compared them to similar factual statements describing the same actions. Results indicated that the inferior parietal lobule, known to support planning of object-directed actions, responded more strongly to high-effort than low-effort statements. Moreover, counterfactual statements, compared to factual ones, recruited a distinctive neural network partially overlapping with action execution networks. This network included medial pre-motor and pre-frontal structures, which underpin selection and inhibition of alternative action representations, and parahippocampal and temporal regions, involved in retrieving episodic memories. We argue that counterfactual comprehension recruit action-related networks encoding and managing alternative representations of behaviors.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/045acfa27936d259055d8260690dc8896f15036e","title":"Counterfactuals in action: an fMRI study of counterfactual sentences describing physical effort.","venue":"Neuropsychologia","year":2012}

The possibility of accomplishing PLF using a mixture of porous β-CPP and iliac bone was studied. This paper reports the radiologic results of PLF using the β-CPP plus autograft for lumbar degenerative disease as a bone graft extender.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA prospective, case-matched, radiographic study evaluating the results of short segment lumbar fusion using a β-CPP plus autograft was performed to compare the efficacy of β-CPP plus autograft with that of an autograft alone for short segment lumbar fusion. Thirty one consecutive patients (46 levels) underwent posterolateral fusion with pedicle screw fixation and additional posterior lumbar interbody fusion. In all patients, 3 mL of β-CPP plus 3 mL of autogenous bone graft was placed randomly in one side of a posterolateral gutter, and 6 mL of autogenous iliac bone graft was placed on the other. The fusion rates, volumes of fusion masses, and bone absorption percentage were evaluated postoperatively using simple radiographs and 3 dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) scans.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe control sides treated with an autograft showed significantly better Lenke scores than the study sides treated with β-CPP at 3 and 6 months postoperatively, but there was no difference between the two sides at 12 months. The fusion rates (confirmed by 3D-CT) were 87.0% in the β-CPP group and 89.1% in the autograft group, which were not significantly different. The fusion mass volumes and bone absorption percentage at 12 months postoperatively were 2.49 mL (58.4%) and 1.89 mL (69.5%) for the β-CPP and autograft groups, respectively, and mean fusion mass volume was significantly higher in the β-CPP group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nβ-CPP combined with an autograft is as effective as autologous bone for grafting during instrumented posterolateral spinal fusion. These findings suggest that β-CPP bone chips can be used as a novel bone graft extender for short-segment posterolateral spinal fusion.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/4f/2a/Clin_Orthop_Surg_2011_Sep_19_3(3)_238-244.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/045d2b59d6657d77a61c880dbda53b4e412d4c1e","title":"The First Clinical Trial of Beta-Calcium Pyrophosphate as a Novel Bone Graft Extender in Instrumented Posterolateral Lumbar Fusion","venue":"Clinics in orthopedic surgery","year":2011}

The ECS is involved in stimulating both the homoeostatic (that is, the sensing of deficient energy balance and gastrointestinal load) and the hedonic (that is, the sensing of the salience and the incentive/motivational value of nutrients) aspects of food intake. The orexigenic effects of endocannabinoids are exerted in the brain by CB(1)-mediated stimulatory and inhibitory effects on hypothalamic orexigenic and anorectic neuropeptides, respectively; by facilitatory actions on dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens shell; and by regulating the activity of sensory and vagal fibres in brainstem-duodenum neural connections. In turn, the levels of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol and/or CB(1) receptors in the brain are under the control of leptin, ghrelin and glucocorticoids in the hypothalamus, under that of dopamine in the limbic forebrain and under that of cholecystokinin and ghrelin in the brainstem. These bi-directional communications between the ECS and other key players in energy balance ensure local mediators such as the endocannabinoids to act in a way coordinated in both 'space' and 'time' to enhance food intake, particularly after a few hours of food deprivation. Alterations of such communications are, however, also among the underlying causes of overactivity of the ECS in hyperphagia and obesity, a phenomenon that provided the rationale for the development of anti-obesity drugs from CB(1) receptor antagonists.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/045d5b9c293da38fca728df3a8e70e687c7947ce","title":"The endocannabinoid system as a link between homoeostatic and hedonic pathways involved in energy balance regulation.","venue":"International journal of obesity","year":2009}

All potential muscles, excluding the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and popliteus, from 10 fresh frozen legs were examined and the following details recorded: (1) the distance above the medial malleolus that the muscle bellies ended (musculotendinous junction), (2) the distance between the medial malleolus and the distal end of the transposed flaps (reach), (3) the area of tibia that could be covered, and (4) the vascular supply to these muscles. The soleus, extensor digitorum longus and peroneus tertius, extensor hallucis longus, peroneus brevis, and flexor digitorum longus were found to be the most anatomically suited muscles for local transposition to selected lower-third defects.

The 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptor is of central interest as a target for the treatment of anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. Research on the clinical significance of the 5-HT(1A) receptor now benefits from the highly selective radioligand [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635 (WAY) for quantitative determination of 5-HT(1A) receptors in the primate and human brain in vivo using PET. In this paper, three studies are reviewed to demonstrate the suitability of WAY as radioligand for quantification of central 5-HT(1A) receptors in brain and as an applicable tool for drug development. In the first study a monkey model was used to characterize WAY binding. It was confirmed that the reference ligand 8-OH-DPAT and psychoactive drugs such as buspirone and pindolol occupies 5-HT(1A) receptors in the primate brain. Pindolol is an beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist with a high affinity to 5-HT(1A) receptors. This drug has been suggested in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of depression and was given to healthy males in the second study. Pindolol induced a marked inhibition of central 5-HT(1A) receptors as calculated by the ratio-analysis method and simplified reference tissue model, 2 h after administration of 10 mg as a single oral dose. This observation suggests that pindolol may have a role for the suggested potentiation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment of depression. The third study was on robalzotan (NAD-299), a recently developed 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist and putative drug with implications for the treatment of depression. In the cynomolgus monkey brain, robalzotan in the dose range 2-100 microg/kg IV occupied 5-HT(1A) receptors in a dose-dependent and saturable manner with a maximal calculated occupancy of 70-80%. The relationship between robalzotan plasma concentration and 5-HT(1A) receptor occupancy could be described by a hyperbolic function that was used to guide the selection of appropriate doses in man. In a subsequent PET study of robalzotan binding to 5-HT(1A) receptors in the living human brain, similar results have been replicated recently. These studies reviewed here illustrate and corroborate that quantitative neuroimaging of receptor binding has potential for the evaluation and dose finding of new central nervous system drugs.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0468ea935b0747c4e4ca26fc8badb001ef55bd6f","title":"Use of PET and the radioligand [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635 in psychotropic drug development.","venue":"Nuclear medicine and biology","year":2000}

Metrics used in the analysis of typing are monographs, digraphs, and trigraphs. Monographs as we define them consist of the time between the press and release of a single key, coupled with the discretized x-y location of the keystroke on the tablet. A digraph is the duration between the presses of two consecutively pressed keys, and a trigraph is the duration between the press of a key and the press of a key two keys later.

PolyBot is a modular, self-reconfigurable system that is being used to explore the hardware reality of a robot with a large number of interchangeable modules. Three generations of PolyBot have been built over the last three years which include ever increasing levels of functionality and integration. PolyBot has shown versatility, by demonstrating locomotion over a variety of terrain and manipulating a variety of objects. PolyBot is the first robot to demonstrate sequentially two topologically distinct locomotion modes by self-reconfiguration.

Previous studies suggest that several of these biogenesis factors function together as modules. Using a heterologous expression system, we show that the large ribosomal subunit (LSU) biogenesis factor Noc1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae can simultaneously interact with the LSU biogenesis factor Noc2p and Rrp5p, a factor required for biogenesis of the large and the small ribosomal subunit. Proteome analysis of RNA polymerase-I-associated chromatin and chromatin immunopurification experiments indicated that all members of this protein module and a specific set of LSU biogenesis factors are co-transcriptionally recruited to nascent ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursors in yeast cells. Further ex vivo analyses showed that all module members predominantly interact with early pre-LSU particles after the initial pre-rRNA processing events have occurred. In yeast strains depleted of Noc1p, Noc2p or Rrp5p, levels of the major LSU pre-rRNAs decreased and the respective other module members were associated with accumulating aberrant rRNA fragments. Therefore, we conclude that the module exhibits several binding interfaces with pre-ribosomes. Taken together, our results suggest a co- and post-transcriptional role of the yeast Rrp5p-Noc1p-Noc2p module in the structural organization of early LSU precursors protecting them from non-productive RNase activity.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/05/48/gks1056.PMC3553968.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/046df44ec914f3aac3e1e69af6814f9f85150130","title":"Rrp5p, Noc1p and Noc2p form a protein module which is part of early large ribosomal subunit precursors in S. cerevisiae","venue":"Nucleic acids research","year":2013}

The first MRI showed a medulloblastoma with signs of infratentorial and supratentorial tumor spreading, including a small frontal mass. Despite the good response to surgical and adjuvant treatment, the frontal mass remained unchanged and was excised, revealing a lipoastrocytoma. Finally, the possible local recurrence of the original medulloblastoma was a pilocytic astrocytoma with post-radiation alterations.

But, simultaneous donor site repigmentation and depigmentation of grafts at the recipient site has been noted. Similarly donor site depigmentation with complete repigmentation of the recipient area with pigment growing out from each graft has been observed. Successful repigmentation after regrafting in previous punch failure cases has also been reported. Koebner's phenomenon from history (Kp-h) and test grafting were the only available indicators to assess stability. It is quite ironic to note that even after four decades of experience in vitiligo surgery, there seems to be little consensus among workers regarding the optimal required period of stability. Moreover, the exact concept of stability in vitiligo is itself still not transparent and defined beyond doubt Overdependence on KpH or TG may be sometimes misleading in vitiligo. These two reveal the apparent clinical stability only and that may not be the true reflection of stability status of the disease at the molecular level. Antimelanocyte cytotoxic reactivity was observed among CD8+ TCC isolated from perilesional biopsies of patients with vitiligo. An attempt should be made to clearly fathom and define stability, not merely only on clinical ground but along with electron microscopy and histoenzymological analysis of the perilesional and nonlesional skin of vitiligo patients. Probably some growth factors which are responsible for both mitogenic and melanogenic stimulation of melanocytes should also be taken into account. Some serological test(s) could guide us to measure these growth factors.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/047792f28678ca4f5a68e34de58aa46ad64c376e","title":"The Concept of Stability of Vitiligo: A Reappraisal","venue":"Indian journal of dermatology","year":2012}

First, it does not estimate the future cost of known required moves, thus increasing search errors. Second, all distortion is penalized linearly, even when appropriate re-orderings are performed. Because the cost function does not effectively constrain search, translation quality decreases at higher distortion limits, which are often needed when translating between languages of different ty-pologies such as Arabic and English. To address these problems, we introduce a method for estimating future linear distortion cost, and a new discriminative distortion model that predicts word movement during translation. In combination, these extensions give a statistically significant improvement over a base-line distortion parameterization. When we triple the distortion limit, our model achieves a +2.32 BLEU average gain over Moses.","pdfUrls":["http://www.spencegreen.com/pubs/green+galley+manning.naacl10.pdf","http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/~mgalley/papers/naacl10-reorder.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N10/N10-1129.pdf","http://www.spencegreen.com/pubs/naacl10-distortion.pdf","http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/N/N10/N10-1129.pdf","http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~antho/N/N10/N10-1129.pdf","http://www.mt-archive.info/NAACL-HLT-2010-Green.pdf","http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/naacl10-distortion.pdf","http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/naacl10-distortion.pdf","http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N10-1129","http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N/N10/N10-1129.pdf","http://nlp.stanford.edu/~mgalley/papers/naacl10-reorder.pdf","http://anthology.aclweb.org/N/N10/N10-1129.pdf","http://www.spencegreen.com/pubs/green+galley+manning.naacl10.slides.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology//N/N10/N10-1129.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04790f8639b211ce28d1a7797d872acc5958f006","title":"Improved Models of Distortion Cost for Statistical Machine Translation","venue":"HLT-NAACL","year":2010}

The selective nature of being self-employed is also modelled, as the most educated are least likely to be self-employed in the first place. General labour market conditions affect the relative closure rates of firms run by highly and less educated owner-managers. Exit probability is lower for the highly educated during recession, but higher in a boom. There are at least two possible reasons for this. First, self-employment is an inferior choice to wage work, particularly for the highly educated, due to lower earnings prospects. Second, the highly educated faced a higher outside demand for their labour than did the less educated during the economic upturn. Regardless of the aggregate economy, firms run by highly educated owner-managers had higher growth probabilities than those run by less educated ones.ammin kuin vähemmän koulutettujen yritykset.","pdfUrls":["http://www.ptt.fi/julkais/keskust/tp38.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/047aa1045f13eaece229b0793b934c3745ccc643","title":"Self-selected Self-employed: the Role of Education in Success***","venue":"","year":2000}

Several in silico approaches [comparative genomics, Blast, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, and pathway enrichment by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)] were employed to investigate global functions of the cotton transcriptome. Cotton EST contigs were clustered into 5,461 groups with a maximum cluster size of 196 members. A total of 27,956 indel mutants and 149,616 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified from consensus contigs. Interestingly, many contigs with significantly high frequencies of indels or SNPs encode transcription factors and protein kinases. In a comparison with six model plant species, cotton ESTs show the highest overall similarity to grape. A total of 87 cotton miRNAs were identified; 59 of these have not been reported previously from experimental or bioinformatics investigations. We also predicted 3,260 genes as miRNAs targets, which are associated with multiple biological functions, including stress response, metabolism, hormone signal transduction and fiber development. We identified 151 and 4,214 EST-simple sequence repeats (SSRs) from contigs and raw ESTs respectively.

In the basal and lower levels of the epithelium, early genes coding for pro-mitotic proteins and viral replication factors are expressed, while terminal cell differentiation is required for activation of late gene expression and production of viral particles at the very top of the epithelium. Such productive infections are normally cleared within 18-24 months. In rare cases, the HPV infection is stuck in the early stage of the infection. Such infections may give rise to cervical lesions that can progress to cancer, primarily cancer of the uterine cervix. Since cancer progression is strictly linked to HPV gene expression, it is of interest to understand how HPV gene expression is regulated. Cis-acting HPV RNA elements and cellular RNA-binding proteins control HPV mRNA splicing and polyadenylation. These interactions are believed to play a particularly important role in the switch from early to late gene expression, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of HPV. Indeed, it has been shown that the levels of various RNA binding proteins change in response to differentiation and in response to HPV induced cervical lesions and cancer. Here we have compiled published data on RNA binding proteins involved in the regulation of HPV gene expression.","pdfUrls":["http://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/5/2/758/pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/047d4d1abe7f6fbe45d3bc67dd1206db6a4ae47e","title":"RNA Binding Proteins that Control Human Papillomavirus Gene Expression","venue":"Biomolecules","year":2015}

Here we address the idea that different thresholds of stimulation determine how progenitors in the dorsal telencephalon interpret these signals. One mechanism for achieving different thresholds of signaling is illustrated by the developmental increase in the level of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression among a subset of progenitors in the late embryonic telencephalon. Another mechanism is illustrated by the antagonistic interaction of BMP with Shh, which can influence EGFR expression and neuron subtype choice. We focus on the similarities and differences in the control of these responses and address the possibility that the gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neuron specification might be linked to progenitor expression of a higher level of EGFRs.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0480ace61225dbc96df1338309730826a23a0e20","title":"Environmental signals elicit multiple responses in dorsal telencephalic progenitors by threshold-dependent mechanisms.","venue":"Cerebral cortex","year":2006}

In this study, we investigated whether bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) influences differentiation toward the osteoblasts lineage. BST2 mRNA expression in human alveolar-derived bone marrow stromal cells (hAD-BMSCs) increased during differentiation into osteoblasts. hAD-BMSCs differentiation into osteoblasts and the mRNA expression of the bone-specific markers alkaline phosphatase, collagen type α 1, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin, and osterix were reduced by BST2 knockdown using siRNA. Furthermore, BST2 knockdown in hAD-BMSCs resulted in decreased RUNX2 mRNA and protein expression. We hypothesized that BST2 is involved in differentiation of into osteoblasts via the BMP2 signaling pathway. Accordingly, we evaluated the mRNA expression levels of BMP2, BMP receptors (BMPR1 and 2), and the downstream signaling molecules SMAD1, SMAD4, and p-SMAD1/5/8 in BST2 knockdown cells. BMP2 expression following the induction of differentiation was significantly lower in BST2 knockdown cells than in cells treated with a non-targeting control siRNA. Similar results were found for the knockdown of the BMP2 receptor- BMPR1A. We also identified significantly lower expression of SMAD1, SMAD4, and p-SMAD1/5/8 in the BST2 knockdown cells than control cells.

Applications that enable people to share location information are becoming increasingly popular. What remains unknown, however, are the factors that influence the use of a location sharing application (LSA). A paper-based survey was implemented with 655 students of six universities in Yogyakarta, Indonesia to test the hypotheses proposed for the study. Results of hierarchical regression analysis reveal that students' use of a specific LSA could be attributed to the two types of benefits of using the app (impression management and entertainment) and to competence-based trust in LSA and to their trust in their LSA network members. Furthermore, the impact of social influence on LSA use is also statistically significant. Mobile phone devices are increasingly used in Indonesia. With approximately 240 million inhabitants, Indonesia has 220 million mobile subscribers – a 92% mobile penetration (Rao, 2012). Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS, 2012) also reported that Indonesians are increasingly accessing the Internet through private devices such as mobile phones and portable computers rather than in Internet cafés. Young people are found to be dominating the mobile devices' user population in Southeast Asia and in Indonesia, in particular. These technology savvy users, according to Rao (2012), primarily used their mobile devices to access the Internet for various types of information while they are on the go. Due to the high rate of mobile device use in Indonesia, the government has been inviting mobile vendors to expand their businesses in the country (Ningsih, 2013). Local Indonesian developers and entrepreneurs regard Indonesia as a solid base for the development of mobile devices alongside mobile applications (Frost, 2012). Various types of mobile applications are offered in the mobile applications market. One well-known type of mobile application is the Social Networking Site (SNS) applications (ComScore, 2013). The growth of SNSs, in general, has pushed enterprises to develop SNS applications that are accessible through mobile devices. These applications enable users to share users' current location, known as location information, through a global positioning system (GPS) and geo-tagging functions. Likewise, stand-alone Location Sharing Applications (LSA) are also available, with Foursquare being the most popular example.

CSF was able to hydrolyze all guanine and adenine nucleotides investigated (2.0 mM): GDPz.Gt;ADP=ATP=GTPz.Gt;AMP=GMP. More detailed studies with the diphosphate nucleotides showed that the hydrolysis of ADP and GDP was linear with incubation time and protein concentration. The apparent K(M) (Henry-Michaelis-Menten constant) and V (maximal velocity) values for ADP and GDP were 164.3+/-54.7 microM and 12.2+/-3.8 nmol P(i)/min per mg protein, and 841.0+/-90.2 microM and 22.8+/-8.0 nmol P(i)/min per mg protein. The sum of ADP, GDP and UDP hydrolysis (2.0 mM) upon individual incubations with CSF was similar to the hydrolysis observed when all three nucleotides were incubated together.

Analysis of aberrant methylation of tumor suppressor genes can be used as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for cancer. In this study, we propose a colorimetric method for the detection of DNA methylation of the paired box gene 1 (PAX1) gene in cervical scrapings obtained from 42 patients who underwent cervical colposcopic biopsy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA thiolated methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) primer was used to generate MSP products labeled with the thiol group at one end. After bisulfite conversion and MSP amplification, the unmodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were placed in a reaction tube and NaCl was added to induce aggregation of bare AuNPs without generating polymerase chain reaction products. After salt addition, the color of AuNPs remained red in the methylated PAX1 gene samples because of binding to the MSP-amplified products. By contrast, the color of the AuNP colloid solution changed from red to blue in the non-methylated PAX1 gene samples because of aggregation of AuNPs in the absence of the MSP-amplified products. Furthermore, PAX1 methylation was quantitatively detected in cervical scrapings of patients with varied pathological degrees of cervical cancer. Conventional quantitative MSP (qMSP) was also performed for comparison.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe two methods showed a significant correlation of the methylation frequency of the PAX1 gene in cervical scrapings with severity of cervical cancer (n=42, P<0.05). The results of the proposed method showed that the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of PAX1 were 0.833, 0.742, and 0.739 for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2 and worse lesions (CIN2+), cervical intraepithelial neoplasms grade 3 and worse lesions (CIN3+), and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting CIN2+ lesions were 0.941 and 0.600, respectively, with a cutoff value of 31.27%. The proposed method also showed superior sensitivity over qMSP methods for the detection of CIN2+ and CIN3+ (0.941 vs 0.824 and 1.000 vs 0.800, respectively). Furthermore, the novel method exhibited higher AUC (0.833) for the detection of CIN2+ than qMSP (0.807).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of thiol-labeled AuNP method were clearly observed by the naked eyes without requiring any expensive equipment. Therefore, the thiol-labeled AuNP method could be a simple but efficient strategy for cervical cancer screening.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0488b16d959da17430df28544b643c0cc645a0d4","title":"Real-time colorimetric detection of DNA methylation of the PAX1 gene in cervical scrapings for cervical cancer screening with thiol-labeled PCR primers and gold nanoparticles","venue":"International journal of nanomedicine","year":2016}

Recent advances have led to a detailed characterization of retinal activity and stimulus encoding by large neural populations. The inverse problem of decoding, where the stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, in particular for complex input movies that should be reconstructed \" pixel-by-pixel \". We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small discs executing mutually-avoiding random motions. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized) decoders that improved significantly over linear decoding results, mostly due to their ability to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous or network activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. Our results suggest a general paradigm in which downstream neural circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity on the basis of higher-order statistical structure intrinsic to the incoming spike trains. Decoding plays a central role in our efforts to understand the neural code [1–4]. While statistical analyses of neural responses can be used to directly estimate [5, 6] or bound [7] the information content of spike trains, such analyses remain agnostic about what the encoded bits might mean or how they could be read out [8]. In contrast, decoding provides an explicit computational procedure for recovering the stimulus from recorded single-trial neural responses, allowing us to ask not only \" how much \" , but also \" what \" the neural system encodes [9]. This is particularly relevant when a rich stimulus is represented by a large neural population— a regime which is increasingly accessible due to recent experimental progress, and the regime that we explore here. One of the hallmarks of large-scale neural activity is the presence of spontaneous and persistent spik-ing [10, 11]. While commonly discussed in a cortical context (e.g, [12, 13]), similar activity can also be observed in the sensory periphery [14–17]. From the viewpoint of any downstream information processing, either by the brain itself or by the decoding algorithms we construct, spontaneous activity presents a confound: if erroneously interpreted as having been caused externally, the system will \" hallucinate \" nonexistent stimuli and will likely respond …","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03373.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03373v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03373v1.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0488bb10a694bfd38044bf02abbb2d9735ba6e66","title":"Nonlinear decoding of a complex movie from the mammalian retina","venue":"","year":2016}

In light of the rapid growth of gross global financial flows and the serious risks associated with them, one might wonder about the continuing relevance of the net financial flow measured by the current account balance. I argue that global current account imbalances remain an essential target for policy scrutiny, for financial as well as macroeconomic reasons. Nonetheless , it is critically important for policymakers to monitor as well the rapidly evolving structure of global gross assets and liabilities. International economic integration puts a country's fortunes partly into the hands of others. When integration takes the form of financial interdependence, the potential domestic impact of external events is magnified manyfold. The global economic crisis of 2007–2009 and the European sovereign debt crisis that followed have unleashed market forces that even policymakers in the mature economies were ill prepared to counteract. The existing informational and institutional structure for global policymaking remains woefully inadequate to the challenge of financial globalization. Even before the global financial crisis, net financial flows between countries, in the form of current account deficits and surpluses, were a focus of policy concern and disagreement. While the general scale and persistence of current account imbalances certainly has increased over the past two decades, even more striking – and potentially more threatening to financial and economic stability – is the rapid","pdfUrls":["http://emlab.berkeley.edu/~obstfeld/JIMF.pdf","http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/obstfeld/JIMF.pdf","http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~obstfeld/JIMF.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/048a006618c9e69e5c3dfeb796444b4db2139054","title":"Financial Flows, Financial Crises, and Global Imbalances","venue":"","year":2012}

This problem, which we call distributed ensemble classification, applies when individual classifiers operate (perhaps remotely) on different sensing modalities and when combining proprietary or legacy classifiers. The conventional wisdom in this case is to apply fixed rules of combination such as voting methods or rules for aggregating probabilities. Alternatively, we take a transductive approach, optimizing the combining rule for an objective function measured on the unlabeled batch of test data. We propose maximum likelihood (ML) objectives that are shown to yield well-known forms of probabilistic aggregation, albeit with iterative, expectation-maximization-based adjustment to account for mismatch between class priors used by individual classifiers and those reflected in the new data batch. These methods are extensions, for the ensemble case, of the work of Saerens, Latinne, and Decaestecker (2002). We also propose an information-theoretic method that generally outperforms the ML methods, better handles classifier redundancies, and addresses some scenarios where the ML methods are not applicable. This method also well handles the case of missing classes in the test batch. On UC Irvine benchmark data, all our methods give improvements in classification accuracy over the use of fixed rules when there is prior mismatch.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/neco.2007.19.3.856"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0498704aa3474b222e35b4aaa417abf1c4240e29","title":"Transductive Methods for the Distributed Ensemble Classification Problem","venue":"Neural Computation","year":2007}

His tax-onomy segmented domains according to the presence/size of local minima and dead-end class. Surprisingly, the taxon-omy has not been used to explain the performance of other planners that use similar heuristics. In this paper, we extend this analysis in several ways: 1) We apply the taxonomy to 10 heuristic search (including FF-2.3) and 17 non-heuristic search planners to determine the extent to which it explains planner performance. 2) We test model scalability by examining a subset of challenging problems to determine the extent to which the topology explains performance. We conclude that topological analysis is a valuable tool in explaining the conditions under which h + is favored. Similar analyses of newer domains and planners could benefit the community and may lead to more informed application, extensions, or simplifications of either the heuristics or the planners that use them.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~mroberts/publications/icaps07c.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04992e13103a3204c946bcc3b315193af8cfabf0","title":"Local Search Topology: Implications for Planner Performance","venue":"","year":2007}

Our strategy is as follows: if C has more than 18 F 8-points, then C may not be hyperelliptic, and so the canonical divisor of C yields an embedding of C into P 3 F 8. The image of C under this embedding is a degree 6 curve which is precisely the intersection of an irreducible cubic hypersurface with an irreducible quadric hypersurface, both defined over F 8. (This is Example IV.5.2.2 in [Har]. Hartshorne works over an algebraically closed field, but his argument is equally valid over the smaller field. See, for example, Theorem III.5.1 in [Har] and Theorem A.4.2.1 in [HS] for the necessary tools.) Consequently, finding the maximum possible number of points on a curve of genus 4 over F 8 is reduced to a finite task: one can write down all cubic hypersur-faces and all quadric hypersurfaces in P 3 , and count the number of points on their intersection. As a practical matter, however, one must make significant reductions before this program becomes computationally feasible. For example, the space of homogeneous cubics in four variables is already 6 3 − 1 = 19-dimensional. We begin in section 2 by noting that up to isomorphism there are only three irreducible quadric surfaces in P 3 F 8 which contain many F 8-points. Therefore we may select representatives of the isomorphism classes and assume that our curve C lies on one of these three specific quadrics. Next, we recall (see [Lau1] and [GV]) that it is known that any curve of genus 4 over F 8 has no more than 27 points, and that such curves with 25 points exist. Moreover, using the techniques of [Lau2], K. Lauter demonstrates in an appendix to this paper that such curves with 26 points do not exist. We may therefore suppose that the curve C for which we are searching has exactly 27 points. In section 3, we employ the following strategy to reduce the problem further.

One motivation for our review is the recent emergence and increasing use of a particular kind of \" program \" in applied microeconomic research, the so-called Regression Discontinuity (RD) Design of Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960). We organize our discussion of these various research designs by how they secure internal validity: in this view, the RD design can been seen as a close \" cousin \" of the randomized experiment. An important distinction which emerges from our discussion of \" heterogeneous treatment effects \" is between ex post (descriptive) and ex ante (predictive) evaluations; these two types of evaluations have distinct, but complementary goals. A second important distinction we make is between statistical statements that are descriptions of our knowledge of the program assignment process and statistical statements that are structural assumptions about individual behavior. Using these distinctions, we examine some commonly employed evaluation strategies, and assess them with a common set of criteria for \" internal validity \" , the foremost goal of an ex post evaluation. In some cases, we also provide some concrete illustrations of how internally valid causal estimates can be supplemented with specific structural assumptions to address \" external validity \" : the estimate from an internally valid \"experimental\" estimate can be viewed as a \" leading term \" in an extrapolation for a parameter of interest in an ex ante evaluation. * We are grateful to Diane Alexander and Pauline Leung, who provided outstanding research assistance.

The performance of the hybrid wireless sensor network is evaluated in terms of surveillance and target detection probability theoretically and by simulations.

By taking into account the basic laws of underwater acoustic propagation, it is shown that unlike in the terrestrial radio systems, both the cell radius R and the frequency reuse number N must satisfy a set of constraints in order to constitute an admissible solution (which sometimes may not exist). The region of admissible (R, N) defines the possible network topologies. It is determined by the user density and the system bandwidth (ρ, B), and by the required signal-to-interference ratio and per-user bandwidth (SIR0, W0). The range of admissible solutions also depends on the choice of operating frequency region. Moving to a higher frequency region than that dictated by SNR maximization, improves the SIR and yields a greater system capacity. I. INTRODUCTION Cellular networks have revolutionized terrestrial mobile communications by introducing the concept of spatial frequency reuse [1]. The simple idea of using the same frequency band in two cells that are sufficiently far apart so that they do not cause interference to each other enables spatial reuse of bandwidth, which in turn ensures coverage of a large area within the practical constraints of finite bandwidth. Since bandwidth is at premium in an acoustic channel, the concept of frequency reuse is an appealing one, and, given the immense success and practicality of terrestrial cellular systems, the question naturally arises as to how does the cellular concept apply to an underwater acoustic environment. Motivated by this question, we address the top-level system design and the implications that acoustic propagation bears on the frequency reuse concept. As an example application, one may think of a fleet of autonomous vehicles, deployed on a collaborative mission to map a wide area of the ocean floor. The base stations in such a system may be mounted on the surface buoys (radio-based infrastructure) or on the bottom (cable-based infrastructure). One could also use both surface and bottom stations to provide full volume coverage in an underwater network. For simplicity, we restrict our attention to a two-dimensional problem. The first task in the design of a cellular network is the selection of network topology, i.e. determination of the cell size (radius) and the reuse pattern.

Indeed, the spinal cord isolated from influence of the brain is capable of convulsive and paroxysmal activity that exhibits the same stereotyped motor pattern seen in the intact animal. This motor pattern can be reproduced experimentally by cooling the isolated spinal cord of amphibians. The isolated spinal cord-hindleg preparation of toad was used. Convulsive activity was induced by placing the isolated spinal cord into a Ringer's bath kept at 7 degrees C. The characteristic phases of the convulsion and their intensity were assessed by recording tonic-clonic contractions of hindleg muscles. Two main endpoints were used to assess the anticonvulsive activity of the drugs tested: first, their ability to block only the tonic hind-limb extension (THE) and second, their ability to block all tonic-clonic activity. The ED50 values and its 95% confidence interval estimated for abolition of THE for each drugs was (mg/kg): carbamazepine 8.6 (6.8-10.8), phenytoin 13 (7.1-23.6), diazepam 0.007 (0.004-0.01), MK-801 3.4 (2.0-5.7), valproate 120 (40-400), phenobarbital 17.1 (12.2-23.9), pentobarbital 10 (6-16.4), mephenesin 2-5 and acetazolamide >500. The ability of some of these drugs to inhibit this kind of seizure activity at doses within therapeutic range suggests a potential use of this isolated preparation as a model in the study and testing of new anticonvulsive drugs.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04a11baa7dc014fad5d7e6c3a6e98974a468dc73","title":"Activity of common anticonvulsant drugs on spinal seizure-induced by sudden cooling.","venue":"Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry","year":2006}

For 7 time steps over the past 30 years Land-sat data were collected for Kakamega Forest and its associated forest areas. Preprocessing involved georeferencing and radiometric corrections. In a first step the time series is evaluated via a threshold analysis distinguishing between \" forest \" and \" non-forest \". Even though a temporally changing pattern of forest losses and replanting is observed, in total no major change in forest-covered area is revealed. Therefore, a supervised multispectral classification is performed distinguishing between classes at the ecosystem level. Ground truthing for the historical imagery is done with the help of maps showing vegetation types or land cover. Actual land cover verification is based on amateur photographs taken from an aeroplane as well as on terrain references. For classification the maximum likelihood decision rule is applied considering bands 3, 4, 5, 7 plus 7/2 for TM/ETM+ imagery and 1, 2, 3 and 4 for MSS-data, repectively. If available, scenes from both the rainy and dry seasons are made use of. From planned 17 land cover classes 12 can be realized, of which 6 belong to forest formations. A shortcome is that plantation forest of Maesopsis eminii (planted mixed in with other indigenous tree species) cannot be separated. Nevertheless, the classification results form a solid basis for a consistent and detailed evaluation of forest history between 1972 and 2001. Analyses presented include graphs of change in land cover class areas over time as well as such allowing for true change detection with transitions between the different classes.","pdfUrls":["http://www.isprs.org/congresses/istanbul2004/comm2/papers/174.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20040910202841/http://www.isprs.org/istanbul2004/comm2/papers/174.pdf","http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXV/congress/comm2/papers/174.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04a22b9291e3f858a82cbbb3194a9c488e2ebd2f","title":"Change-detection in Western Kenya – the Documentation of Fragmentation and Disturbance for Kakamega Forest and Associated Forest Areas by Means of Remotely-sensed Imagery","venue":"","year":2004}

This paper summarises the empirical literature on the effectiveness of early intervention programmes for employment and education outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a systematic review of employment/education outcomes for early intervention programmes, distinguishing three programme types: (1) those providing supported employment, (2) those providing unspecified vocational services and (3) those without vocational services. We summarised findings for 28 studies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEleven studies evaluated early intervention programmes providing supported employment. In eight studies that reported employment outcomes separately from education outcomes, the employment rate during follow-up for supported employment patients was 49%, compared with 29% for patients receiving usual services. The two groups did not differ on enrolment in education. In four controlled studies, meta-analysis showed that the employment rate for supported employment participants was significantly higher than for control participants, odds ratio = 3.66 [1.93-6.93], p < 0.0001. Five studies (four descriptive and one quasi-experimental) of early intervention programmes evaluating unspecified vocational services were inconclusive. Twelve studies of early intervention programmes without vocational services were methodologically heterogeneous, using diverse methods for evaluating vocational/educational outcomes and precluding a satisfactory meta-analytic synthesis. Among studies with comparison groups, 7 of 11 (64%) reported significant vocational/education outcomes favouring early intervention over usual services.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn early intervention programmes, supported employment moderately increases employment rates but not rates of enrolment in education.

Hospital. Investigations of 106 of these cases revealed a fluid-fluid level within the tumor. All patients underwent surgery via a transsphenoidal route. The mean follow-up duration was 46 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe tumors varied in size: 31 were between 1 and 3 cm, and 75 were larger than 3 cm in maximum dimension (mean maximum dimension 3.4 cm). Fifty-two tumors had 1 fluid level, 11 had 2, and 43 had multiple fluid levels (> or = 3). The onset of symptoms was acute in 8 cases and insidious in 98 cases. In 16 cases, there was evidence of acute exacerbation of symptoms during the course of symptom progression. The symptoms were progressive in all cases. Ninety-seven percent of patients had visual deficits at the time of presentation. The solid portion of the tumor was relatively friable and vascular in most cases, and the fluid varied in color and in consistency, from a thin yellow to dark red liquid. Visual outcome was extremely gratifying in the majority of cases; of those presenting with visual dysfunction, 94% reported visual recovery in the immediate postoperative period. During the follow-up period, there was tumor recurrence in 21 cases; in 12 of these cases, the authors documented a fluid-fluid level. The histological features did not indicate malignancy in any case.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA fluid level within a fluid cavity in pituitary tumors is rarely reported but is not uncommon in large/giant tumors. The presence of such a feature suggests that surgery in these cases can be relatively straightforward despite the lesion's large size, and the visual outcome is gratifying. However, recurrence rates are relatively higher in such cases than in other pituitary tumors.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04ac9552e9ba040d7239e7bf40bdeb167ab2f071","title":"Fluid-fluid level in pituitary tumors: analysis of management of 106 cases.","venue":"Journal of neurosurgery","year":2010}

To quantify this impact, a novel metric called test robustness is proposed and to mitigate test escapes, a new process variation-aware test generation method is presented. The method exploits the observation that logic faults that have high probability of occurrence and correspond to significant amounts of undetected bridge resistance have a high impact on test robustness and therefore should be targeted by test generation. Using synthesised ISCAS benchmarks with realistic bridge locations, results show that for all the benchmarks, the method achieves better results (less test escapes) than tests generated without consideration of process variation.","pdfUrls":["http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/267253/1/acceptreview.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04b32babe06ab2c3237efc5e775a6d758e517a97","title":"Ieee Transactions on Computer-aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems 1 Process Variation-aware Test for Resistive Bridges","venue":"","year":2009}

Fig. 1. (A) A 6-mm-sized, protruding , verrucous papule on the left cheek. (B) Central keratotic plug surrounded by epithelial proliferation (H&E, ×20). Dear Editor: Keratoacanthoma is a relatively common epithelial tumor that originates in the pilosebaceous glands and bears a pathological resemblance to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Several cases of keratoacanthoma in association with other lesions such as SCC, nevus comedonicus, ver-rucous cell carcinoma, and cutaneous horn have been reported. Herein, we report a rare case of keratoacantho-ma and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) present in a single tumor nest. A 46-year-old male patient presented with a rapidly growing lesion on his left cheek, which had developed 6 weeks previously. He had no relevant medical or family history. Physical examination revealed a 6-mm-sized, protruding verrucous papule on the cheek (Fig. 1A). The edges were raised and the central portion was crateriform with a kera-tin plug. A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed with a clinical impression of verruca vulgaris or keratoacanthoma. Biopsy specimen results were consistent with keratoacan-thoma (Fig. 1B), without features of solar elastosis or basal layer dysplasia. Complete removal of the keratoacantho-ma was performed by surgical excision. The excision specimens were composed of two sections. One section exhibited remnant keratoacanthoma, whereas the other section was consistent with BCC (Fig. 2). The BCC contained palisading basaloid cells and a cleft between the tu","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/75/09/ad-27-237.PMC4377427.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04b4d14012364bd030d3117e76b3494cf9919881","title":"A Case of Keratoacanthoma Associated with Basal Cell Carcinoma","venue":"Annals of dermatology","year":2015}

The data quality assessment process has to consider both aspects and, consequently, select a suitable evaluation function to obtain a correct interpretation of results.

Glutathione S-transferase-mediated transport has been proposed as a mechanism involved in flavonoid transport, however, whether binding of flavonoids to glutathione S-transferase (GST) or their transport is glutathione-dependent is not well understood. Glutathione S-transferases from Vitis vinífera (VviGSTs) have been associated with the transport of anthocyanins, however, their ability to transport other flavonoids such as proanthocyanidins (PAs) has not been established. Following bioinformatics approaches, we analyzed the capability of VviGST1, VviGST3, VviGST4, and Arabidopsis TT19 to bind different flavonoids. Analyses of protein-ligand interactions indicate that these GSTs can bind glutathione and monomers of anthocyanin, PAs and flavonols. A total or partial overlap of the binding sites for glutathione and flavonoids was found in VviGST1, and a similar condition was observed in VviGST3 using anthocyanin and flavonols as ligands, whereas VviGST4 and TT19 have both sites for GSH and flavonoids separated. To validate the bioinformatics predictions, functional complementation assays using the Arabidopsis tt19 mutant were performed. Overexpression of VviGST3 in tt19-1 specifically rescued the dark seed coat phenotype associated to correct PA transport, which correlated with higher binding affinity for PA precursors. VviGST4, originally characterized as an anthocyanin-related GST, complemented both the anthocyanin and PA deposition, resembling the function of TT19. By contrast, VviGST1 only partially rescued the normal seed color. Furthermore the expression pattern of these VviGSTs showed that each of these genes could be associated with the accumulation of different flavonoids in specific tissues during grapevine fruit development. These results provide new insights into GST-mediated PA transport in grapevine and suggest that VviGSTs present different specificities for flavonoid ligands. In addition, our data provide evidence to suggest that GST-mediate flavonoid transport is glutathione-dependent.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04b9542bdb62d2a9fa28a6a64b2dff1a36efc5cb","title":"Differential Roles for VviGST1, VviGST3, and VviGST4 in Proanthocyanidin and Anthocyanin Transport in Vitis vinífera","venue":"Frontiers in plant science","year":2016}

Industry prefers to use PID controllers and to make experimental settings on-line (mostly with the use of Ziegler and Nichols rules), i.e., a modelless approach. The proposed approach, based on evaluating the frequency responses, uses tools provided by classical linear theory, but it can be applied to control loops with non-linear behaviour. In the theory, a set of quality control indicators usually interpreted by means of a Nyquist plot has been derived. The new idea is to excite a frequency response to small oscillations added to the control error from an external oscillator, and to analyse the response to them from the output of the controlled plant in a closed control loop. This method has an advantage over the Åström and Hägglund relay method: closed loop measurement. This means that the control function is not interrupted while the controller is being set. The paper describes one way of experimentally obtaining the control quality indicators and using them in a new optimal controller parameter setting computation procedure.","pdfUrls":["http://akce.fs.vsb.cz/2007/asr2007/Proceedings/papers/261.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04ba6455565ef066b69bd4a210f58fa02e12126a","title":"Control Quality Indicators in Controller Autotuning Assessed from Excited Oscillations in a Control Loop","venue":"","year":2007}

We then advocate the need for a set of web services that distributed applications can use to define and manipulate time granularities. As an example of these services we discuss in detail the GSTP service, a constraint solver for networks of temporal constraints with time gran-ularities, developed at the University of Milan, and based on recently published theoretical results. The GSTP service can be accessed from applications through the Internet as a web service, or can be accessed by a human user through a sophisticated java interface. A system demonstration will be given during the talk. 1 Modeling and reasoning with time granu-larity Any time granularity can be viewed as the partitioning of a time domain in groups of elements, where each group is perceived as an indivisible unit (a granule). The description of a fact, action, or event can use these granules to provide them with a time qualification, at the appropriate abstraction level. Hence, from the standpoint of representation formalisms , time granularity can be defined as the resolution power of the time qualification of a statement. For the same reason time granularities have been historically devised to model astronomical (e.g., year, day, month) as well as social and economic phenomena (e.g, business day, trading day, weekends, academic semesters). Reflecting the complexity of these phenomena, the relationships among time granular-ities are not always straightforward. Moreover, some of the granularities have the same name but different semantics in countries adopting different calendars or even when used * This work has been partially supported by Italian MIUR (FIRB \" Web-Minds \" project). by different organizations (e.g., business days may vary depending on the country but also on specific companies). The naive approach commonly used in computer science is simplifying the domain representation forcing a conversion into a standard date format and/or to a single time gran-ularity. Alternatively, custom solutions are built into the applications. However, a lot of work has been done recently to formalize the concept of time granularity, to identify relationships , and to reason with non-standard time granu-larities. Despite the literature on time granularity is quite rich, we identify two main approaches: a temporal logic approach [6] and a set-theoretic approach [2]. The logic approach is focused on embedding the notion of granular-ity in a temporal logic …","pdfUrls":["http://webmind.di.unimi.it/gstp/time03.pdf","http://webmind.dico.unimi.it/gstp/time03slides.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/TIME.2003.1214871"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04bdffe9e7af617cc5107e8feb19c32579691e31","title":"Web services for time granularity reasoning","venue":"TIME","year":2003}

Locally, visual patterns are highly ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations. Image structures surrounding the pattern being analyzed can provide additional constraints or context to disambiguate the interpretation. The resulting ▶contextual influences are ubiquitous in visual perception and manifest at the neuronal level as the modulation of the activity of neurons by image structures outside their ▶classical receptive fields. Characteristics The study of contextual influences in visual processing has a long history in psychology and neuroscience [1]. Investigations of these effects in the visual system have focused on the ▶modulatory effect on the activity of a neuron by image structures outside its localized ▶receptive field. The classical approach employs the simplest stimuli such as bars and sinusoidal gratings to probe the interaction between the stimuli presented inside and outside a neuron's classical receptive field. A prevalent finding is that neurons in both the ▶primary visual cortex (striate cortex, V1) and the ▶extrastriate cortex exhibit ▶feature contrast enhancement, i.e., the cells respond better when the stimulus attributes in the area surrounding their receptive fields, such as bar orientation, are different from those inside their receptive fields (Fig. 1a). Recent approaches seek to understand the neural basis of the perceptual interpretation of the local receptive field stimulus by changing the global image context (Fig. 1b). With this approach, a number of neural correlates of perception have been revealed, providing insights into the representation of subjective perceptual experience in the brain. Contextual Influences in the Primary Visual Cortex Neurons in the primary visual cortex receive converging input from the ▶lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). A neuron's classical receptive field, also known as the minimum responsive field, is the part of visual space in which the presence of appropriate features can excite the neuron. By definition, stimulating the visual space outside a neuron's classical receptive field cannot evoke a response. Modulation of neuronal activity by surround stimulation can be observed, however, only when the neuron is responding to a stimulus presented to its receptive field. This modulation is called the non-classical or ▶extra-classical receptive field effect. Such effects have been considered neural manifestations of contextual influences in visual perception. A variety of extra-classical receptive field effects have been identified. A commonly reported phenomenon is called ▶surround suppression: the …","pdfUrls":["http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~tai/papers/enc_neuroscience08.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04bf0ad57860be8d522a1e7c7356ada8580a25c4","title":"C Contextual Influences in Visual Processing","venue":"","year":2008}

people use sensori-motor cortices to understand language? Here we review neurocognitive studies of language comprehension in healthy adults and evaluate their possible contributions to theories of language in the brain. We start by sketching the minimal predictions that an embodied theory of language understanding makes for empirical research, and then survey studies that have been offered as evidence for embodied semantic representations. We explore four debated issues: first, does activation of sensori-motor cortices during action language understanding imply that action semantics relies on mirror neurons? Second, what is the evidence that activity in sensori-motor cortices plays a functional role in understanding language? Third, to what extent do responses in perceptual and motor areas depend on the linguistic and extra-linguistic context? And finally, can embodied theories accommodate language about abstract concepts? Based on the available evidence, we conclude that sensori-motor cortices are activated during a variety of language comprehension tasks, for both concrete and abstract language. Yet, this activity depends on the context in which perception and action words are encountered. Although modality-specific cortical activity is not a sine qua non of language processing even for language about perception and action, sensori-motor regions of the brain appear to make functional contributions to the construction of meaning, and should therefore be incorporated into models of the neurocognitive architecture of language.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/2c/43/Front_Psychol_2011_Jun_3_2_116.tar.gz","http://qa-pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:561578:8/component/escidoc:993567/Willems_Flexibility%20in%20embodied%20language%20understanding_Front_Psych_2011.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/2c/43/fpsyg-02-00116.PMC3132681.pdf","http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:561578/component/escidoc:993567/Willems_Flexibility%20in%20embodied%20language%20understanding_Front_Psych_2011.pdf","http://qa-pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:561578/component/escidoc:993567/Willems_Flexibility%20in%20embodied%20language%20understanding_Front_Psych_2011.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04bf1d27fe0831928cc119dbf6f5d6b2cb37d9e7","title":"Flexibility in Embodied Language Understanding","venue":"Front.

Hence, we evaluated social cognitive variables and perceptions of the school environment to predict PA and fitness in middle school children (N = 506, ages 10-14 years). Using multiple regression analyses we accounted for 12% of the variance in PA and 13-21% of the variance in fitness. The best predictors of PA were barrier self-efficacy, classmate social support, and gender; whereas, only gender predicted fitness. The results affirmed the importance of barrier self-efficacy and gender differences. Our findings regarding classmate social support are some of the first to illuminate the importance of school-specific peers in promoting PA.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04ca0d4fd2f50bdd83c710090f939edf4425c5f7","title":"Using social cognitive theory to predict physical activity and fitness in underserved middle school children.","venue":"Research quarterly for exercise and sport","year":2011}

The children with autism engaged in fewer acts of high level play. The children with autism also had significantly lower social functioning than the DLD group early in the play session; however, these differences were no longer apparent by the end of the play session.

We demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) induces within seconds a large, tyrosine-kinase-dependent increase in calcium channel currents in cerebellar granule neurons. Separation of channel subtypes reveals that, while P, Q, and R channels are unaffected, N and L channel activities are strongly potentiated at specific membrane voltages: N currents triple at depolarized potentials, while L currents rapidly increase 4-fold at hyperpolarized potentials. Moreover, transient expression of dominant-negative and wild-type phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase) subunits, as well as application of specific inhibitors, demonstrates that PI 3-kinase is an essential and rate-limiting messenger in this signaling pathway. Our results indicate that N and L calcium channels are downstream targets of neuronal RTKs and suggest that RTK modulation may control calcium-dependent processes, such as neurotransmitter release and IGF-1-dependent differentiation or survival.","pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0896627300809502","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627300809502"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04d1deeddf5a9cbc4964d508fd237758a1e6d238","title":"IGF-1 Modulates N and L Calcium Channels in a PI 3-Kinase-Dependent Manner","venue":"Neuron","year":1997}

Eight agrammatic aphasic participants (four of whom had undergone treatment focused on comprehension and production of filler-gap sentences) and 24 young normal participants listened to sentences and pressed a button when the sentences \"stopped making sense.\" Critical sentences contained an anomaly in object relative clauses or conjoined clauses. Results showed that both young normals and aphasic participants were able to reject anomalous sentences of both types. In addition, both groups showed evidence of filler-gap resolution on-line. Importantly, however, there was evidence of a treatment effect for the aphasic patients: those who received treatment showed better performance than those who had not. Treated patients were more successful than the untreated patients in detecting the anomaly in filler-gap conditions, rejecting the anomalous filler-gap sentences reliably more often than the non-anomalous ones, like the young normals. This effect was not noted for untreated participants, i.e., there was no statistical difference between their rejection of anomalous and non-anomalous filler gap sentences. Further, the reaction time data showed that the treated aphasic patients' rejections came before sentence's end (within 2000 ms), while the majority of responses made by untreated patients did not. These results indicate that individuals with agrammatic aphasia appear to retain some gap-filling capacity and that treatment can improve their ability to make use of this capacity.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04d2d45865ec7655a6ef6741aafac464a449dcd5","title":"The resolution and recovery of filler-gap dependencies in aphasia: evidence from on-line anomaly detection.","venue":"Brain and language","year":2004}

This program searches for a given DNA motif within the entire genome of one species and uses the gene association information of a potential transcription factor-binding site (TFBS) to screen the homologous regions of a second and third species. If multiple species have this potential TFBS in homologous positions, this program recognizes the identified TFBS as an evolutionary conserved motif (ECM). This program outputs a list of ECMs, which can be uploaded as a Custom Track in the UCSC genome browser and can be visualized along with other available data. The feasibility of this approach was tested by searching the genomes of three mammals (human, mouse and cow) with the DNA-binding motifs of YY1 and CTCF. This program successfully identified many clustered YY1- and CTCF-binding sites that are conserved among these species but were previously undetected. In particular, this program identified CTCF-binding sites that are located close to the Dlk1, Magel2 and Cdkn1c imprinted genes. Individual ChIP experiments confirmed the in vivo binding of the YY1 and CTCF proteins to most of these newly discovered binding sites, demonstrating the feasibility and usefulness of ECMFinder.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04d435832034f5343cd69b4b25fba2b9ed2ae765","title":"Evolutionary Conserved Motif Finder (ECMFinder) for genome-wide identification of clustered YY1- and CTCF-binding sites","venue":"Nucleic acids research","year":2009}

Indeed in an earlier paper [36] I analysed why so many employees question the very existence of business ethics. My own experiences in business lead me to feel some discomfort with much of what I read in the academic literature because it somehow didn't seem to address the real concerns of anyone having to make their way in working life. The denial of the existence of ethics in business by employees takes many forms. Many feel that following the letter of a company ethical code is all that is required of them; there is no requirement for any additional responsibility. Others share the view of Friedman that the only \"social responsibility of business is to increase its profits\" [1]. It is clear however, that we all have moral standards, whether we recognise them or not. Many employees believe that, whilst they themselves do not wish to be absolved of responsibility for their actions at work, neither they or anyone else in business is required to be morally responsible. Bird and Waters [2] have written about the phenomenon of managers refusing to acknowledge the moral content of their thought and behaviour, preferring to explain apparently altruistic acts in terms of utility to the company. The Moral Muteness of Managers is the term they use to describe the phenomenon. Business itself however tends to take a much more actively responsible role with regard to business ethics. In the UK, the Business In The Community organisation is made up of 400 of the largest British companies, 300 of which contribute 0.5% of pre-tax profits to charitable projects. Further, whilst it may be true that there is little awareness of ethical issues among managerial and clerical staff, there does seem to be an increasing readiness of companies to attempt to change this situation. Between 1987 and 1991 a quarter of companies surveyed internationally had sponsored new ethics programs and there was a 40% increase in the number of European company CEOs making ethical pronouncements [15]. The reason why companies seem to be coming more ethical (or least seem to be trying to do so) whilst their employees appear to believe that the organisations for which they work and the people with whom they work are …","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/308364.308367"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04df6b9b3fb3dc602fc98c76fea12050d2812fbd","title":"Business ethics and privacy in the workplace","venue":"SIGCAS Computers and Society","year":1998}

The difference in polypeptide expression before and after transplantation had been compared by using CLINPROT technology, and serum ferritin levels have been analyzed simultaneously. Through combining serum ferritin and MS spectral data, the diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of our model for prewarning severe aGVHD (III~IV°aGVHD) before transplant all increased to 90.0%, while after transplant, the sensitivity and specificity are 78.3% and 86.4%.

Historically, our practice may have been accurately labeled as \" experience-based, \" \" eminence-based, \" or \" habit-based \" (e.g., Law, 2002). In these times of increasing demands on accountability and research utilization, professionals rendering services to people with disabilities are being asked to consider research evidence as part of their clinical and educational decision making. There is a growing consensus that EBP should involve the integration of the best and most current research evidence with clinical/educational expertise and relevant stakeholder perspectives in the pursuit of making the best possible decisions for a particular consumer (e. EBP is not practice that is driven by research evidence alone, which is a popular misconception. The key ingredient of this definition is integration. A practitioner has to consider not only the external research evidence related to a particular diagnostic tool or a treatment approach that is being considered for a consumer, but also the data (and other knowledge) generated from this consumer and his or her perspectives and preferences. This is by far not a cookie-cutter approach to practice but rather a creative process. For practitioners who seek to implement EBP, the following process has been delineated: (1) ask a well-built question, (2) select evidence sources, (3) implement a search strategy, (4) appraise and synthesize the evidence, (5) apply the evidence, and (6) evaluate the evidence application (e.g., Sackett et al., 2000). Schlosser (2003) added the dissemination of the findings as a seventh step so that others may benefit from what has been learned. This last step also allows EBP to come full circle in that practitioners and relevant stakeholders have a means to influence the direction of future research. This process requires knowledge and skills in several key areas, such as searching the literature efficiently for the best and most current evidence relevant to the question at hand as well as knowledge and skills in the critical appraisal of evidence. The latter includes a working knowledge of factors that contribute to the internal validity of evidence and its external validity in order to determine how transportable the data are to the particular question. Many practitioners in the disability and rehabilitation field may not be adequately prepared for this task, creating a formidable knowledge and skill …","pdfUrls":["http://ktdrr.org/ktlibrary/articles_pubs/ncddrwork/focus/focus15/Focus15.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04e4b6c9e48dac86632ffc2babb6402efb582d20","title":"Evidence-based Practice Role of Systematic Reviews in Ebp the Role of Systematic Reviews in Evidence-based Practice, Research, and Development","venue":"","year":2006}

Although the right hemisphere is predominantly linked to the processing of affective prosodic cues, existing literature also suggests that damage to the left hemisphere can result in similar deficits. This study aims to demonstrate, and add to the evidence, that patients with left-hemisphere injury experience difficulties with affective prosodic perception and production, measured via a new combination of assessments and analyses. It is also hypothesised that aphasia severity will be correlated with impaired processing of affective prosody.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStroke and control participants differed significantly on prosody perception tests of matching auditory affective cues to visual images. Prosodic production was measured by participants vocalising different affective expressions of words and monosyllables - from which significant differences were found in perceptual judgements of emotion accuracy and intensity, and acoustic analyses of pitch range and variance. There were significant correlations between participants' Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) scores, quality of life, and prosody production.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIndividuals with left-hemisphere damage after stroke have impaired affective prosodic perception and production that may be associated with reduced quality of life.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04e8b6e08722cc59d629b950777e184d3b2ed2f0","title":"Affective speech prosody perception and production in stroke patients with left-hemispheric damage and healthy controls.","venue":"Brain and language","year":2016}

Unlike centralized platforms and web-based distributed systems, these distributed sensor-actuator network (DSAN) systems are characterized by a massive number of potentially failing nodes, limited energy and bandwidth resources, and the need to rapidly respond to sensor input. As application developers, we must fundamentally rethink the organization and programming of these deeply embedded systems. What is the appropriate mental model we can use to reason about the collective behaviors of a system when programming a distributed application so that the application is portable, scalable, and robust? What are the organizational principles for developers to build large applications by mixing and matching various ad hoc communication protocols while shielded from dealing with a multitude of communication events? How does the software architecture expose the underlying system constraints so that application developers can consider important performance trade-offs? This article describes a state-centric, agent-based design methodology to mediate between a system developer's mental model of physical phenomena and the distributed execution of DSAN applications. Building on the ideas of data-centric networking , 1 sensor databases, 2 and proximity-based group formation, 3 we introduce the notion of collaboration groups, which abstracts common patterns in application-specific communication and resource allocation. An application developer specifies computations as the creation, aggrega-tion, and transformation of states, which naturally map to the vocabulary used by signal processing and control engineers. More specifically, programmers write applications as algorithms for state update and retrieval, with input supplied by dynamically created collaboration groups. As a result, programs written in the state-centric framework are more invariant to system configuration changes, making the resulting software more modular and portable across multiple platforms. Using a distributed tracking application with sensor networks , we'll demonstrate how state-centric programming can raise the abstraction level for application developers. Sensor-actuator network systems offer unique advantages over traditional centralized approaches. Dense networks of distributed sensors can improve perceived signal-to-noise ratio by reducing Networked embedded systems must be able to rapidly respond to all kinds of sensing events, even though they have numerous failure-prone nodes and limited energy and bandwidth resources. The design methodology and software environment described here mediate between the developer's mental model of physical phenomena and the distributed application.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/class/fa05/cs598tar/papers/Pervasive03-FZhao-StateCentricProg.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/zhao/pubs/state-centric-programming.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/~zhao/pubs/state-centric-programming.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MPRV.2003.1251169","http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/liuj/publications/state-centric-programming.pdf","http://www2.parc.com/spl/projects/ecca/pubs/Liu-PervComp2003.pdf","http://www.parc.com/cosense/pub/state-centric-ieee-pervasive-oct03.pdf","http://www.research.microsoft.com/~zhao/pubs/state-centric-programming.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04e9f9e666d8876715372f4a3fabbd0ca7b7164c","title":"State-Centric Programming for Sensor-Actuator Network Systems","venue":"IEEE Pervasive Computing","year":2003}

This metabolic switch is mediated by the lac repressor (LacI), which in the absence of lactose binds to the operator DNA sequence to inhibit transcription. Allosteric rearrangements triggered by binding of the lactose isomer allolactose to the core domain of the repressor impede DNA binding and lift repression. In Nature, the ability to detect and respond to environmental conditions comes at the cost of the encoded enzymes being constitutively expressed at low levels. The readily-switched regulation provided by LacI has resulted in its widespread use for protein overexpression, and its applications in molecular biology represent early examples of synthetic biology. However, the leakiness of LacI that is essential for the natural function of the lac operon leads to an increased energetic burden, and potentially toxicity, in heterologous protein production.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of the features that confer promiscuity to the inducer-binding site of LacI identified tryptophan 220 as a target for saturation mutagenesis. We found that phenylalanine (similarly to tryptophan) affords a functional repressor that is still responsive to IPTG. Characterisation of the W220F mutant, LacIWF, by measuring the time dependence of GFP production at different IPTG concentrations and at various incubation temperatures showed a 10-fold reduction in leakiness and no decrease in GFP production. Cells harbouring a cytotoxic protein under regulatory control of LacIWF showed no decrease in viability in the early phases of cell growth. Changes in responsiveness to IPTG observed in vivo are supported by the thermal shift assay behaviour of purified LacIWF with IPTG and operator DNA.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn LacI, long-range communications are responsible for the transmission of the signal from the inducer binding site to the DNA binding domain and our results are consistent with the involvement of position 220 in modulating these. The mutation of this single tryptophan residue to phenylalanine generated an enhanced repressor with a 10-fold decrease in leakiness. By minimising the energetic burden and cytotoxicity caused by leakiness, LacIWF constitutes a useful switch for protein overproduction and synthetic biology.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04ebd4a603961ea1a5d1cec321534988c6404f0a","title":"A single mutation in the core domain of the lac repressor reduces leakiness","venue":"Microbial cell factories","year":2013}

In the past decade, however, the potential to restore lost hearing has been intensively investigated using molecular and cell biological techniques, and we can now part with such a pessimistic view. In this review, we examine an important field in hearing restoration research: cell transplantation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMost efforts in this field have been directed to the replacement of hair cells by transplantation to the cochlea. Here, we focus on transplantation to the auditory nerve, from the side of the cerebellopontine angle rather than the cochlea.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDelivery of cells to the cochlea is potentially damaging, and nerve cells transplanted distally to the Schwann-glial transitional zone (cochlear side) may become inhibited when they reach the transitional zone. The auditory nerve is probably the most suitable route for cell transplantation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe auditory nerve occupies an important position not only in neurosurgery but also in various diseases in other disciplines, and several lines of recent evidence indicate that it is a key target for hearing restoration. It is familiar to most neurosurgeons, and the recent advances in the molecular and cell biology of inner-ear development are of direct importance to neurorestorative medicine. In this article, we review the anatomy, development, and molecular biology of the auditory nerve and cochlea, with emphasis on the advances in cell transplantation.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04ed2d1d2cff7877700704ca176cb72390806229","title":"Rebuilding lost hearing using cell transplantation.","venue":"Neurosurgery","year":2007}

We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study including all 1,015,912 singletons born in Denmark from 1987 to 2001. A total of 29,094 children were born to women who lost a close relative during pregnancy or up to 1 year before pregnancy. These children were included in the exposed cohort and other children were in the unexposed cohort. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios for ADHD, defined as the first-time ADHD hospitalization or first-time ADHD medication after 3 years of age. Boys born to mothers who were bereaved by unexpected death of a child or a spouse, had a 72% increased risk of ADHD [hazard ratio (HR) 1.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.73]. Boys born to mothers who lost a child or a spouse during 0-6 months before pregnancy and during pregnancy had a HR of 1.47 (95% CI 1.00-2.16) and 2.10 (95% CI 1.16-3.80), respectively.

Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in neurotransmission, neuroprotection, neurotoxicity and pathological pain, as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the central nervous system. Therefore, this experiment was performed in order to assess the analgesic effects of single and multiple-dosed ip administration of silymarin and the probable role of nitric oxide or opioid receptors using tail flick assay. Results: Based on our results, only silymarin 100 mg/kg showed analgesic properties. Since naloxone did not change silymarin's analgesic effects, it is concluded that opioid receptors are not involved. Although in the presence of L-arginine, analgesic effect of silymarin remained intact, but it is not possible to strongly determine the involvement of nitric oxide pathway here. Based on our results, the difference between anti nociceptive properties of single and multiple-dosed treatment of silymarin 100 mg/kg is not significant. Conclusion: It is concluded that silymarin exert its analgesic effects via other mechanisms. Inhibiting 5-lipooxygenase and neutrophil chemotaxis to inflammation location could be the probable ways of silymarin's action.","pdfUrls":["http://ajp.mums.ac.ir/article_27_88b88182a6d5744a534cb3fb039549a6.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/04fc64afd6bae391359007205620dbc896d10ae0","title":"Evaluation of Nitric Oxide or Opioid Receptors Involvement in Antinociceptive Properties of Silymarin","venue":"","year":2011}

Conventionally, the TMS coil is mounted to a static holder and the subject is asked to avoid head motion. Additionally, head resting frames have been used. In contrast, our robotized TMS system employs active motion compensation (MC) to maintain the correct coil position.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS\nWe study the effect of patient motion on TMS. In particular, we compare different coil positioning techniques with respect to the induced electric field.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe recorded head motion for six subjects in three scenarios: (a) avoiding head motion, (b) using a head rest, and (c) moving the head freely. Subsequently, the motion traces were replayed using a second robot to move a sensor to measure the electric field in the target region. These head movements were combined with 2 types of coil positioning: (1) using a coil holder and (2) using robotized TMS with MC.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter 30 min the induced electric field was reduced by 32.0% and 19.7% for scenarios (1a) and (1b), respectively. For scenarios (2a)-(2c) it was reduced by only 4.9%, 1.4% and 2.0%, respectively, which is a significant improvement (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the orientation of the induced field changed by 5.5°, 7.6°, 0.4°, 0.2°, 0.2° for scenarios (1a)-(2c).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhile none of the scenarios required rigid head fixation, using a simple holder to position a coil during TMS can lead to substantial deviations in the induced electric field. In contrast, robotic motion compensation results in clinically acceptable positioning throughout treatment.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05005020b03317d7f4d61ab5699892b91c8a210d","title":"Stimulus intensity for hand held and robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation.","venue":"Brain stimulation","year":2013}

We then report some experiments with magnetic and infrared sensors from Crossbow Technologies. We built a network of these sensors and ran human subjects through it engaged in various activities, some involving carrying of ferromagnetic materials. Results indicated that a variety of suspicious activities could be detected, though not all mock IEDs triggered detection, and triangulation was difficult due to the tendency of the signal to quickly saturate. Our network design is such that data can be easily aggregated in larger networks for broad-area automated monitoring of settings such as airports and busy urban areas.","pdfUrls":["http://www.dodccrp.org/events/13th_iccrts_2008/CD/html/papers/118.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/050522e41b99797bb9c67f41894f9b7fc576b80d","title":"3 Th Iccrts: C2 for Complex Endeavors Assessment of Electromagnetic and Passive Diffuse Infrared Sensors in Detection of Ied-related Behavior","venue":"","year":2008}

Adult males possess bilateral penises called hemipenes, which are independently controlled by two muscles, the retractor penis magnus (RPM) and transversus penis (TPN). These structures are not obvious in adult females. However, in adult female leopard geckos (Eublepharis macularius), testosterone induces hemipene growth. We investigated whether these structures develop de novo in adulthood or are histologically present as rudimentary structures in the female leopard gecko. We also investigated the extent of sexual dimorphisms and plasticity in the associated neuromuscular components. To do this, we compared copulatory morphology (sizes of hemipenes, RPM and TPN muscle fibers, and associated motoneurons, as well as motoneuron and RPM fiber number) in adult females treated with testosterone, control females, and control males. All of the geckos possessed hemipenes, RPMs and TPNs, but these structures were indeed vestigial in control females. Testosterone induced striking increases in hemipene and copulatory muscle fiber size in females, but not to levels equivalent to control males. In parallel, males with increased levels of androgenic activity had larger hemipenes, suggesting naturally occurring steroid-induced plasticity. Copulatory motoneurons were not sexually dimorphic in size or number, and these measures did not respond to testosterone. The data demonstrate that the copulatory system of leopard geckos, in which gonadal sex is determined by egg incubation temperature, differs from that of many species (both reptilian and mammalian) with genotypic sex determination. Indeed, the system is remarkable in that adult females have normally occurring intersex characteristics and they exhibit substantial steroid-induced morphological plasticity in adulthood.","pdfUrls":["https://www.msu.edu/~wadej/manuscripts/Gecko.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05055f9bd6b98218e9605ccb9054f2c5eeb70239","title":"Normally occurring intersexuality and testosterone induced plasticity in the copulatory system of adult leopard geckos.","venue":"Hormones and behavior","year":2005}

Using rodent tumours, then human tumour xenografts and most recently human tumour cell lines, the DTP has developed screening systems with the aim of identifying compounds with potential clinical activity. The tumours and cell lines in the screens were largely selected because of their sensitivity to known, clinically active, anticancer drugs and results from the DTP screens have contributed to the development of many of the cytotoxic drugs in widespread clinical use today. In line with the vast majority of academic drug development groups and pharmaceutical companies, the DTP now focuses on mechanism-based drug discovery, which it is widely anticipated will result in the identification of compounds with greater activity and anti-tumour specificity than that seen with cytotoxic drugs. Extensive experience with anti-endocrine therapy for the treatment of hormone-dependent tumours, and more recently with trastuzumab and STI571, for the treatment of C-erbB2 over-expressing breast cancer and bcr-abl positive leukaemias, respectively, provides encouragement for target-based drug discovery programmes. The move away from screening to mechanism-based approaches to drug discovery represents a watershed, and an opportunity to reflect on pre-clinical antitumor models and their utility. The experience of the NCI DTP and Cancer Therapy Evaluation Programme (CTEP) is second to none, and the paper by Johnson and colleagues in this issue has seized this opportunity. In addition to providing a retrospective analysis of the relative abilities of in vitro cell line, hollow fibre and xenograft models to predict clinical activity this paper, as the authors point out, constitutes an important benchmark against which future results will be measured. Whilst we confidently predict that mechanism-based drug development will out-perform screening approaches in the discovery of active agents, we need hard data to show that this is the case and the paper from the DTP and CTEP provides these data for pre-clinical studies with conventional cytotoxic drugs. Lastly, even with drugs designed to exploit cancer-related targets, models are still needed to provide confidence that clinical activity can be realistically anticipated, which raises the question of which models to use. With greater experience, it may one day be possible to move in one step from a genomic or proteomic analysis of clinical material through drug design and development to a clinical trial without the use of any pre-clinical tumour models. However, such a day is still some way off and Phase I clinicians, regulatory authorities, ethics …","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/83/7d/84-6691797a.PMC2363634.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/050af0bc74ff44ff9ef040fd5445cb1650868e97","title":"Flasks, fibres and flanks – pre-clinical tumour models for predicting clinical antitumour activity","venue":"British journal of cancer","year":2001}

Complex expressions, skewed or correlated data, and changing conditions can cause the optimizer to make mistakes. For example, the optimizer may pick a poor join order, overlook an important index, use a nested-loop join when a hash join would have done better, or cause an expensive, but avoidable, sort to happen. SQL tuning is also needed while tuning multi-tier services to meet service-level objectives. The difficulty of SQL tuning can be lessened considerably if users and higher-level tuning tools can tell the optimizer: \" I am not satisfied with the performance of the plan p being used for the query Q that runs repeatedly. Can you generate a (δ%) better plan? \" This paper designs, implements, and evaluates Xplus which, to our knowledge, is the first query optimizer to provide this feature. Xplus goes beyond the traditional plan-first-execute-next approach: Xplus runs some (sub)plans proactively, collects monitoring data from the runs, and iterates. A nontrivial challenge is in choosing a small set of plans to run. Xplus guides this process efficiently using an extensible architecture comprising SQL-tuning experts with different goals, and a policy to arbitrate among the experts. We show the effectiveness of Xplus on real-life tuning scenarios created using TPC-H queries on a PostgreSQL database.","pdfUrls":["http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~vldb2010/proceedings/files/papers/R102.pdf","https://users.cs.duke.edu/~shivnath/papers/xplus.pdf","http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vldb2010/papers/R102.pdf","http://vldb.org/pvldb/vldb2010/pvldb_vol3/R102.pdf","http://www.cs.duke.edu/~shivnath/papers/xplus.pdf","http://vldbarc.org/pvldb/vldb2010/papers/R102.pdf","http://vldbarc.org/pvldb/vldb2010/pvldb_vol3/R102.pdf","http://www.cs.duke.edu/~hero/files/vldb10-xplus.pdf","http://vldb.org/pvldb/vldb2010/papers/R102.pdf","http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vldb2010/pvldb_vol3/R102.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/050b6ae24c5185a2cd16b44772d941ccc498d31c","title":"Xplus: A SQL-Tuning-Aware Query Optimizer","venue":"PVLDB","year":2010}

The MPP Tracking (MPPT) is an essential part in achieving this improvement. Some of the existing techniques such as Perturb-and-Observe (P&O) and Incremental Conductance (INC) are relatively simpler to implement, but under rapidly changing irradiance and temperature conditions, they fail to track the MPP. Although methods such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) are efficient in tracking the MPP, their implementation increases the system complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel artificial intelligence based controller for MPPT, which can efficiently track the MPP, while keeping the computational complexity within the limits. Our technique uses Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (FLANN) to predict the PV output voltage at the MPP. Since there is no hidden layer, FLANN is computationally inexpensive. Simulation results verify that the proposed FLANN controller is computationally less intensive and exhibits higher efficiency under rapidly changing weather conditions.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288335","http://mirlab.org/conference_papers/International_Conference/ICASSP%202012/pdfs/0002141.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0511f1bf9bda4b911d8026add593a4900468f20b","title":"A flann-based controller for maximum power point tracking in PV systems under rapidly changing conditions","venue":"ICASSP","year":2012}

Seventeen subjects performed an incremental exercise test and 1-5 prolonged exercise tests on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion at intervals of 1 week, and work rates, oxygen uptake (VO2) values and brachial venous blood lactate (BLa) levels were measured. It was proposed that when exercising at a constant workload below AnT, BLa would fall after having reached its peak; at the level of AnT, BLa reaches maximal steady-state (BLaSsmax); and above AnT, BLa increases continuously. Altogether, in 34 of 45 tests with a constant workload between 80 and 125% AnT, BLa values were as expected. In those cases in which BLaSsmax was reached, BLa increased on average by 3.8 mM from resting levels. This increase was 2.0 mM greater than that seen between resting levels and AnT during incremental exercise. There was no correlation between BLa values at BLaSsmax and at AnT, both when expressed as an increase in BLa (delta BLa) and absolute BLa concentration. Altogether, 81% of the variation in BLa concentration at BLaSsmax could be explained by the subjects' age, the percentage of slow-twitch fibres and BLa levels at rest. The AnT and BLaSsmax did not differ significantly, and these values were correlated (r = 0.83). Together, AnT and age accounted for 85% of the variation seen in BLaSsmax. The BLaSsmax did not correlate with AnT when fixed at a BLa concentration of 4 mM (AnT4mM).

Early adverse events are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In animal models, maternal deprivation and social isolation predispose to gastric erosion and brain pathology. This study examined (1) brain effects of chronic gastrointestinal inflammation in a rat model of acquired IBD and (2) whether such changes are resolved by individual secretin (S) or oxytocin (OT) peptide treatment. Neurological manifestations of IBD were mapped by c-fos gene expression in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10) with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBD vs controls (n = 11). IBD was characterized by moderate/severe infiltration of inflammatory cells 10 d after TNBS infusion. Age-matched pairs were processed for immunocytochemical detection of Fos, expressed when neurons are stimulated. S or OT (100 mg/250 mL saline) or equivolume saline was administered iv by Alzet pump for 20 d after disease onset. Degree of resolution of colitis-induced brain activation was assessed by c-fos expression, and mean numbers of Fos-immunoreactive nuclei for each group were compared using Independent Samples T-test. Chronic IBD activated periventricular gray, hypothalamic/visceral thalamic stress axes and cortical domains, and septal/preoptic/amygdala, brain areas abnormal in autism. Single peptide treatment with S or OT did not alter the effects of inflammation on the brain. Brain areas concomitantly activated by visceral inflammation are those often abnormal in autism, suggesting that IBD could be a model for testing treatments of autism. Other single and combined peptide treatments of IBD should be tested. The clinical implications for treating autism, IBD, and concomitant sickness behaviors with peptide therapy, with or without maternal nurturing as a natural equivalent, are presented.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0515ea5ff155c70dfc760729131c611efac5a059","title":"Brain effects of chronic IBD in areas abnormal in autism and treatment by single neuropeptides secretin and oxytocin.","venue":"Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN","year":2005}

Calorimeter response is largely determined by the transfer of energy E e from the hadronic to the electromagnetic sector via π 0 production. Fluctuations in this quantity produce the \" constant term \" in hadron calorimeter resolution. The increase of its fractional mean, f 0 em = E e /E, with increasing incident energy E causes the energy dependence of the π/e ratio in a noncompensating calorimeter. The mean hadronic energy fraction, f 0 h = 1 − f 0 em , was shown to scale very nearly as a power law in E: f 0 h = (E/E 0) m−1 , where E 0 ≈ 1 GeV for pions, and m ≈ 0.83. It follows that π/e = 1−(1−h/e)(E/E 0) m−1 , where electromagnetic and hadronic energy deposits are detected with efficiencies e and h, respectively. Fluctuations in these quantities, along with sampling fluctuations, are incorporated to give an overall understanding of resolution, which is different from the usual treatments in interesting ways. The conceptual framework is also extended to the response to jets and the difference between π and p response.","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0605164v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0605164v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0605164v3.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0605164v4.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0518b682bde4b8dd99913d572950b98de3442a1a","title":"Energy Flow in a Hadronic Cascade: Application to Hadron Calorimetry","venue":"","year":1998}

Starting from the basic denitions of roles, their application in security and the basics of the concept of mandatory access control, we develop a scheme of role-based protection that realizes mandatory access control. The basis of this formulation develops from the recognition that roles can be seen as facilitating access to some given information context. By handling each of the role contexts as independent security levels of information , we simulate mandatory access by imposing the requirements of mandatory access control. Among the key considerations, we propose a means of taming Trojan horses by imposing acyclic information ow among contexts in role-based protection systems. The acyclic information ows and suitable access rules incorporate secrecy which is an essential component of mandatory access control.","pdfUrls":["http://www.csd.uwo.ca/faculty/sylvia/mandatory1.ps"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/051a1447ef909a464b9aa83047fd388b3755866b","title":"Modeling Mandatory Access Control in Role-Based Security Systems","venue":"DBSec","year":1995}

It is found that more educated parents make greater educational investments in both goods and time and that these relationships are generally robust to a rich set of controls. Evidence suggests that making greater investments in both goods and time stems both from higher expected returns to education for children and from different preferences for education among more educated parents. A second key finding is that the marginal effect of mother's education on educational investments is generally larger than that of father's education.","pdfUrls":["http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=gansu_papers"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/052552ed4411c248ae1a75fffb4c20e3032cdc61","title":"Keeping Teachers Happy: Job Satisfaction among Primary School Teachers in Rural Northwest China","venue":"","year":2014}

Human functional neuroimaging technology can study the intact human brain to elucidate its functional neuroanatomy and the neurobiological mechanism of the placebo effect. Blood flow measurement using functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) has revealed that analgesia is related to decreased neural activities in pain-modulatory brain regions, such as the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), insula, thalamus, and brainstem including periaqueductal gray (PAG) and ventromedial medulla. The endogenous opioid system and its activation of mu-opioid receptors are thought to mediate the observed effects of placebo. The mu-opioid receptor-selective radiotracer-labeled PET studies show that the placebo effects are accompanied by reduction in activation of opioid neural transmission in pain-sensitive brain regions, including rACC, prefrontal cortex, insula, thalamus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAC) and PAG. Further PET studies with dopamine D2/D3 receptor-labeling radiotracer demonstrate that basal ganglia including NAC are related to placebo analgesic responses. NAC dopamine release induced by placebo analgesia is related to expectation of analgesia. These data indicate that the aforementioned brain regions and neurotransmitters such as endogenous opioid and dopamine systems contribute to placebo analgesia.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0526e3604e27fd43bfbd910315f04dd7773e5527","title":"Neuroimaging study of placebo analgesia in humans.","venue":"Neuroscience bulletin","year":2009}

Bauso, L. Giarre, G. Neglia, Active queue management stability in multiple bottleneck networks, IEEE ICC'04, vol. 4, June 2004, pp. 2267– 2271]. In this paper, we study the stability of more general AIMD (Additive Increase and Multiplicative Decrease)/RED system with multiple bottlenecks that may incur non-negligible packet losses. We develop a general mathematical model to analyze network stability for both delay-free and delayed AIMD/RED systems. Sufficient conditions for the asymp-totic stability of multiple-bottleneck systems with heterogeneous delays are derived by appealing to Lyapunov stability theory with Lyapunov–Razumikhin conditions, and these conditions can be easily assessed by using LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) Toolbox. Numerical results with Matlab and simulation results with NS-2 are given to validate the analytical results. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control mechanism is a key technology for the worldwide information infrastructure, the Internet, and is deployed in the end-systems to maintain network stability and integrity in a distributed manner. The core of the Internet can be simple and scalable, and an IP router serves all incoming packets in a First-In First-Out (FIFO) fashion. In particular, in the TCP/RED (Random Early Detection) mechanism, the excessive arrival packets are buffered in a queue when the aggregated packet arrival rate exceeds the packet departure rate, and a RED-enabled router discards the incoming packets randomly when the average queue length exceeds a certain threshold (min th) and all incoming packets are discarded when the average queue length exceeds another higher threshold (max th). Since packet losses in the Inter-net are mainly due to network congestion, a TCP sender uses packet losses as network congestion indicators and adjusts its sending rate accordingly with a congestion window , which limits the maximum number of packets being sent without acknowledgments. TCP congestion control is implemented via the Additive Increase and Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) mechanism: when there is no congestion indication (no packet loss), the TCP …","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2008.10.009","http://bbcr.uwaterloo.ca/~xshen/paper/2009/saombn.pdf","http://bbcr.uwaterloo.ca/~xshen/paper/2009/pre_saombn.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0528b5150e3ba70db72697225a9d9b13e214a858","title":"Stability analysis of multiple-bottleneck networks","venue":"Computer Networks","year":2009}

In this paper the attention has been given towards the design of a good elliptical lowpass filter with sharp transition between passband and stopband, negligible passband insertion loss and wide stop band. A new defected ground structure (DGS) consisting of two square slots connects with a rectangular slot by two thin transverse slots underneath a microstrip line is proposed. In the frequency characteristics of proposed unit pattern provides an attenuation zero close to an attenuation pole. As a result, better transition sharpness, lower passband insertion loss and broader stopband are observed compares to dumbbell DGS. An equivalent lumped L-C network is proposed to model the introduced DGS unit and corresponding L-C parameters are extracted. A 3rd order quasi-elliptic lowpass filter with 1.4 GHz cutoff frequency, 1.7 GHz attenuation pole frequency, negligible passband insertion loss, almost 100 dB/GHz sharpness factor and 1.56GHz passband bandwidth (at-15 dB) is designed by cascading three investigated DGS units of different dimensions under capacitively loaded microstrip line. 1. Introduction A defected structure etched in the metallic ground plane of a microstrip line is attractive solution for achieving finite pass band, rejection band and slow-wave characteristics. The defected structure effectively disturbs the shield current distribution in the ground plane and thus, introduces high line inductance and capacitance of the microstrip line. Thus, it obtains wide stop band and compact size, which meet emerging application challenges. Dumb-bell shaped DGS is explored first time by D. Ahn and applied to design a lowpass filter [1,2]. Unit cell has been described as a one-pole Butterworth filter, where the capacitance comes only from the gap and the inductance comes only from the loop. The study of dumbbell DGS with various head shape have appeared in the literature recently and they are used to design filters, couplers, dividers and amplifiers [3-5] and [7-9]. It is well known that a filter with attenuation poles and attenuation zeros at finite frequencies shows higher selectivity compared to all pole filter. A DGS with quasi-elliptical response was proposed by Chen J.-X recently [6]. In this paper, an asymmetric DGS pattern with reference to transmission line is proposed.

The pathologic lesions of the GBS suggest that this syndrome has an immunologic basis: a humoral factor is probably not the only immunological mechanism and cellular mechanisms are also likely to be of importance. Specific mechanisms might also be present in GBS, such as anti-idiotypic suppression of autoantibodies, and elimination of circulating immune complexes. Treatment with IVIG might have several therapeutic advantages over plasmapheresis: IVIG is easily infused without any delay, is easily available and has been used widely without serious complications.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/052995f779899ae9a33636b3684b0e5ea92dcd57","title":"[Value of intravenous immunoglobulins.

A time-interleaved A–D converter (ADC) system is an effective way to implement a high-sampling-rate ADC with relatively slow circuits. This paper analyzes the benefits and derives an upper band on the performance by considering kT/C noise and slewing requirement of the circuit driving the system. In the system, several channel ADCs operate at interleaved sampling times as if they were effectively a single ADC operating at a much higher sampling rate. A timing mismatch calibration technique is proposedthat covers linear and nonlinear channel mismatches, unifies, and extends the channel models. A novel foreground channel mismatch identification method has been developed, which can be used to fully characterize dynamic linear mismatches. A background identification method provides accurate timing mismatch estimates.","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.6040v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.6040v1.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0530f713c4faa3323a68ea792ce2a4bb760dc4b5","title":"International journal of advanced scientific and technical research Issue 4 volume 1, January-February 2014 Available online on http://www.rspublication.com/ijst/index.html ISSN 2249-9954","venue":"","year":2014}

Proliferating cells were obtained in approximately 40% of preparations with each mitogen, were immunoreactive for the intermediate filament nestin, and did not express neuronal- or glial-specific markers. Early passage neuroepithelial precursor cells were pluripotent and differentiated into neurons expressing MAP2a,b, NF-M, and TuJ1, and GFAP-positive astrocytes; however, oligodendrocytes were never seen. As the cells were passaged from P0 to P4, the percentage of differentiating neurons significantly decreased and the prevalence of astrocytes significantly increased. While the majority of cell populations from individual preparations stopped proliferating between 3 and 6 passages, two expanding cell lines have been successfully expanded in EGF and FGF2 for over 25 passages and have been maintained in culture for over one year. These cells express nestin and not other cell-specific lineage markers. When differentiated, these neuroepithelial cell lines differentiate only into astrocytes, showing no expression of any neuronal marker. These data suggest that continued passage under these conditions preferentially selects for spinal cord neural precursors that are restricted to the astrocytic lineage.

computing has emerged as a preferred platform for deploying scalable web-applications. With the growing scale of these applications and the data associated with them, scalable data management systems form a crucial part of the cloud infrastructure. <i>Key-Value</i> stores -- such as Bigtable, PNUTS, Dynamo, and their open source analogues-- have been the preferred data stores for applications in the cloud. In these systems, data is represented as <i>Key-Value</i> pairs, and atomic access is provided only at the granularity of <i>single keys</i>. While these properties work well for current applications, they are insufficient for the next generation web applications -- such as online gaming, social networks, collaborative editing, and many more -- which emphasize collaboration. Since collaboration by definition requires consistent access to <i>groups</i> of keys, scalable and consistent <i>multi key</i> access is critical for such applications. We propose the Key Group abstraction that defines a relationship between a group of <i>keys</i> and is the granule for on-demand transactional access. This abstraction allows the Key Grouping protocol to collocate control for the keys in the group to allow efficient access to the group of keys. Using the Key Grouping protocol, we design and implement G-Store which uses a <i>key-value</i> store as an underlying substrate to provide efficient, scalable, and transactional <i>multi key</i> access. Our implementation using a standard <i>key-value</i> store and experiments using a cluster of commodity machines show that G-Store preserves the desired properties of <i>key-value</i> stores, while providing <i>multi key</i> access functionality at a very low overhead.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~sudipto/papers/socc10-das.pdf","http://cs.ucsb.edu/~sudipto/papers/socc10-das.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1807128.1807157"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0538e05e1ced11b91cda5d1aed88a73969def882","title":"G-Store: a scalable data store for transactional multi key access in the cloud","venue":"SoCC","year":2010}

The overall objective of the Seattle Japanese American Community Diabetes Study was to learn more about the etiology and pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in Japanese Americans. This metabolically based epidemiologic study included extensive assessments of insulin sensitivity, insulin response, and adiposity with the latter including measurements of body fat distribution by both anthropometry and computed tomography. Because of this, the importance of visceral adiposity as a risk factor for abnormal glucose tolerance, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and the metabolic syndrome was demonstrated. In conjunction with an examination of diet and physical activity patterns, the result was a clearer understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in Japanese Americans. Wepropose that a lifestyle that fosters increased weight gain, especially in the visceral adipose depot, promotes the development of insulin resistance which in turn exposes an underlying reduced beta-cell reserve in susceptible individuals, resulting in glucose intolerance and eventually in many the development of diabetes. We have shown that it may be possible to delay or prevent the development of diabetes through dietary and exercise interventions in individuals identified as having impaired glucose tolerance. The lessons learned from studying migrant Japanese in Seattle may in many ways be applicable to other populations of Asian origin.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0539faa0800bf6a5c5db8253f0035c6852c4d899","title":"Risk factors for type 2 diabetes: Lessons learned from Japanese Americans in Seattle","venue":"Journal of diabetes investigation","year":2012}

Von Mühlenen, Rempel, and Enns (Psychological Science 16: 979-986, 2005) showed that a color change can capture attention as effectively as the onset of a new object given that it occurs during a period of temporal calm, where no other display changes happen. The current study presents a series of experiments that further investigate the conditions under which a change in color captures attention, by disentangling the change signal from the onset of a singleton.

When the number of kernels d to be combined is very large, multiple kernel learning methods whose computational cost scales linearly in d are intractable. We propose a randomized version of the mirror descent algorithm to overcome this issue, under the objective of minimizing the group p-norm penalized empirical risk. The key to achieve the required exponential speed-up is the computationally efficient construction of low-variance estimates of the gradient. We propose importance sampling based estimates, and find that the ideal distribution samples a coordinate with a probability proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding gradient. We show the surprising result that in the case of learning the coefficients of a polynomial kernel, the combinatorial structure of the base kernels to be combined allows the implementation of sampling from this distribution to run in O(log(d)) time, making the total computational cost of the method to achieve an-optimal solution to be O(log(d)// 2), thereby allowing our method to operate for very large values of d. Experiments with simulated and real data confirm that the new algorithm is computationally more efficient than its state-of-the-art alternatives.","pdfUrls":["http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/afkanpour13.pdf","http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v28/afkanpour13.pdf","http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/afkanpour13.html","http://www.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/papers/mkl_icml2013.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0288v2.pdf","http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/afkanpour13.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/053a969418d9983d32f87e1ba1f2f63c4354fbdb","title":"A Randomized Mirror Descent Algorithm for Large Scale Multiple Kernel Learning","venue":"ICML","year":2013}

Although no epidemiologic link was established, the virus was related to the H7N2 virus circulating in the live-bird market system (LBMs) since 1994. An avian-influenza Task Force (TF), comprised of industry, state and federal personnel, was utilized in the control programme. The use of good safety and biosecurity practices was emphasized by TF commanders. Carcass-disposal options, which included burial in sanitary landfills, incineration and composting, proved to be problematic and caused delays in depopulation of infected premises. Surveillance activities focused on once-a-week testing of dead birds from all premises, biweekly testing of all breeder flocks and pre-movement testing. Additional surveillance carried out in backyard flocks and local waterfowl did not detect the H7 virus or specific antibodies to the virus. The outbreak emphasized the need to establish effective biosecurity barriers between the LBMs and commercial poultry. Avian influenza (AI) is a viral disease that can affect many species of wild and domestic birds, including poultry. The AI virus (AIV) is comprised of 15 subtypes based on differences in antigenic nature of the surface haemagglutinin (HA) protein and is classified, based on pathogenicity, into low-pathogenic (LPAI) and highly pathogenic (HPAI) viruses (Swayne and Halvorson 2003). The natural reservoirs of avian influenza virus (AIV) are migratory waterfowl and shorebirds (Kawaoka et al. 1988; Slemons et al. 1974). However, the live-bird market system (LBMs) has been recognized as a significant man-made reservoir of poultry-adapted AIV and has been implicated in several outbreaks of AIV in commercial poultry in the United States (Committee on Transmissible Diseases of Poultry and Other Avian Species 2002; Davison et al. 2003). The highly pathogenic form of AI is extremely contagious and lethal, causing sudden death in poultry, often without any warning signs of infection.

Many studies have focused on the role of CD8 TRM in protection; however, there is now accumulating evidence that CD4 TRM predominate in tissue sites, and are integral for in situ protective immunity, particularly in mucosal sites. New evidence suggests that mucosal CD4 TRM populations differentiate at tissue sites following the recruitment of effector T cells by local inflammation or infection. The resulting TRM populations are enriched in T-cell specificities associated with the inducing pathogen/antigen. This compartmentalization of memory T cells at specific tissue sites may provide an optimal design for future vaccination strategies. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that CD4 TRM may also play a role in immunoregulation and immunopathology, and therefore, targeting TRM may be a viable therapeutic approach to treat inflammatory diseases in mucosal sites. This review will summarize our current understanding of CD4 TRM in diverse tissues, with an emphasis on their role in protective immunity and the mechanisms by which these populations are established and maintained in diverse mucosal sites.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/053feea7a74dc0ef6401d9386855540dda4564e2","title":"Mucosal Resident Memory CD4 T Cells in Protection and Immunopathology","venue":"Front.

This process is essential for oocyte-to-embryo transition in many species. However, how the fertilization signal reaches the cortical granules for their timely exocytosis is largely unknown. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the recruitment of separase, a downstream effector of the fertilization signal, to the cortical granules is essential for exocytosis because separase is required for membrane fusion. However, the molecule that recruits separase to the cortical granules remains unidentified. In this study, we found that Rab6, a Golgi-associated GTPase, is essential to recruit separase to the cortical granules in C. elegans embryos. Knockdown of the rab-6.1 gene, a Rab6 homolog in C. elegans, resulted in failure of the membrane fusion step of cortical granule exocytosis. Using a transgenic strain that expresses GFP-fused RAB-6.1, we found that RAB-6.1 temporarily co-localized with separase on the cortical granules for a few minutes and then was dispersed in the cytoplasm concomitantly with membrane fusion. We found that RAB-6.1, as well as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-1 and anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), was required to recruit separase to the cortical granules. RAB-6.1 was not required for the chromosome segregation process, unlike CDK-1, APC/C and SEP-1.

While this verdict sent shockwaves amongst P2P networks, piracy remains rampant, and this incident further exacerbated relations between file sharers and Hollywood. In retaliation, supporters of P2P file-sharing attacked websites of the law firms representing the Hollywood studios (Johnson, 2009). This victory by Hollywood studios may be a Pyrrhic defeat in the long run if the studios do not soften their antagonistic relations with the public. This chapter explores structural and cultural conflicts amongst security actors that make fighting piracy extremely difficult. In addition, it considers the role of law enforcement, government, industries, and the general public in creating long-term security models.","pdfUrls":["http://www.igi-global.com/viewtitlesample.aspx?id=71023&ptid=67395&t=policing+of+movie+and+music+piracy:+the+utility+of+a+nodal+governance+security+framework"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0547db66733d2fb431dcda3830d39123aa56d586","title":"Policing of Movie and Music Piracy: the Utility of a Nodal Governance Security Framework Policing of Movie and Music Piracy","venue":"","year":2015}

However, the utilization of random values in the velocity calculation decreases the performance of these techniques; that is, during the velocity computation, we normally use random values for the acceleration coefficients and this creates randomness in the solution. To address this problem, an adaptive acceleration particle swarm optimization (AAPSO) technique is proposed. To evaluate our proposed method, we employ both face and iris recognition based on AAPSO with SVM (AAPSO-SVM). In the face and iris recognition systems, performance is evaluated using two human face databases, YALE and CASIA, and the UBiris dataset. In this method, we initially perform feature extraction and then recognition on the extracted features. In the recognition process, the extracted features are used for SVM training and testing. During the training and testing, the SVM parameters are optimized with the AAPSO technique, and in AAPSO, the acceleration coefficients are computed using the particle fitness values. The parameters in SVM, which are optimized by AAPSO, perform efficiently for both face and iris recognition. A comparative analysis between our proposed AAPSO-SVM and the PSO-SVM technique is presented.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/fe/13/TSWJ2014-835607.PMC3984833.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/054b52f202456d9c51c8537f28b9956af96ba800","title":"Support Vector Machine Based on Adaptive Acceleration Particle Swarm Optimization","venue":"TheScientificWorldJournal","year":2014}

We compared the credible participants against a sample of 74 non-credible patients who appeared to have been attempting to feign low intelligence specifically (FSIQ ≤ 75), as well as a larger non-credible sample (n = 383) unselected for IQ. The entire non-credible group scored significantly higher than the credible participants on measures of verbal crystallized intelligence/semantic memory and manipulation of overlearned information, while the credible group performed significantly better on many processing speed and memory tests. Additionally, credible women showed faster finger-tapping speeds than non-credible women. The credible group also scored significantly higher than the non-credible subgroup with low IQ scores on measures of attention, visual perceptual/spatial tasks, processing speed, verbal learning/list learning, and visual memory, and credible women continued to outperform non-credible women on finger tapping.

In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a domain description { as used in most hierarchical planners { has proven useful. In this paper we present examples which illustrate signiicant drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change of representation language of planning cases from concrete to abstract. However, to achieve a powerful change of the representation language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which describe admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain model. This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Reenement in an Integrated System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically learned from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning in mechanical engineering shows signiicant advantages of the proposed reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning.","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume3/bergmann95a.pdf","http://jair.org/media/160/live-160-1460-jair.pdf","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ralph_Bergmann/publication/1961013_Building_and_Refining_Abstract_Planning_Cases_by_Change_of_Representation_Language/links/0c96051d282b838adf000000.pdf?origin=publication_list","http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume3/bergmann95a.ps.Z","http://www.jair.org/media/160/live-160-1460-jair.pdf","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ralph_Bergmann/publication/1961013_Building_and_Refining_Abstract_Planning_Cases_by_Change_of_Representation_Language/links/0c96051d282b838adf000000.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0551a927ebb3762a3434b324a80bb700cd0f1c81","title":"Building and Reening Abstract Planning Cases by Change of Representation Language","venue":"","year":1995}

A total of 412 patients were classified into two groups according to different criteria, PF and NOPF according to PF occurrence: CR-PF (grades B and C) and NOCR-PF (grade A) based on PF severity. A total of 28 factors were evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression test. Hospital charges and stays of these patients were assessed. The results showed that more hospital stages and charges are needed for patients in PF and CR-PF groups than in NOPF and NOCR-PF groups (P < 0.05). The excessive drinking, soft remnant pancreas, preoperative albumin, and intraoperative blood transfusion are risk factors affecting both PF and CR-PF incidence. More professional surgeons can effectively reduce the PF and CR-PF incidence. Patients with PF and CR-PF need more hospital costs and stages than that in NOPF and NOCR-PF groups.

introduce a path following algorithm for L 1-regularized generalized linear models. The L 1-regularization procedure is useful especially because it, in effect, selects variables according to the amount of penalization on the L 1-norm of the coefficients, in a manner that is less greedy than forward selection–backward deletion. The generalized linear model path algorithm efficiently computes solutions along the entire regularization path by using the pre-dictor–corrector method of convex optimization. Selecting the step length of the regularization parameter is critical in controlling the overall accuracy of the paths; we suggest intuitive and flexible strategies for choosing appropriate values. We demonstrate the implementation with several simulated and real data sets.","pdfUrls":["http://www.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/JRSSB.69.4%20(2007)%20659-677%20Park.pdf","http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/glmpath.jrssb.pdf","http://www.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/glmpath.pdf","http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/JRSSB.69.4%20(2007)%20659-677%20Park.pdf","http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/JRSSB.69.4%20(2007)%20659-677%20Park.pdf","http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/glmpath.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/055538aed1d84b1217b7d084adf6a3be6c5cebda","title":"L 1 -regularization Path Algorithm for Generalized Linear Models","venue":"","year":2006}

An important parameter for tumor prognosis is the number of mitotic cells present in histologically stained breast cancer tissue sections. We propose a hierarchical learning workflow for automated mitosis detection in breast cancer. From an initial training set a pixel-wise classifier is learned to segment candidate cells, which are then classified into mitotic and non-mitotic cells using object shape and texture features. Our workflow banks on two open source biomedical image analysis software: \" ilastik \" and \" CellCognition \" which provide a user user friendly interface to powerful learning algorithms, with the potential of making the pathologist work an easier task. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 35 high-resolution histopathological images from 5 different specimen (provided by International Conference for Pattern Recognition 2012 contest on Mitosis Detection in Breast Cancer Histological Images). Based on the candidate segmentation our approach achieves an area-under Precision-Recall-curve of 70% on an annotated dataset, with good localization accuracy, little parameter tuning and small user effort.

Records are assigned locations within the circle as a function of its relative attraction to each of the DAs. The DAs can be moved either interactively or algorithmically to reveal different meaningful patterns in the dataset. In this paper we describe Vectorized Radviz (VRV) which extends the number of dimensions through data flattening. We show how VRV increases the power of Radviz through these extra dimensions by enhancing the flexibility in the layout of the DAs. We apply VRV to the problem of analyzing the results of multiple clusterings of the same data set, called multiple cluster sets or cluster ensembles. We show how features of VRV help discern patterns across the multiple cluster sets. We use the Iris data set to explain VRV and a newt gene microarray data set used in studying limb regeneration to show its utility. We then discuss further applications of VRV.","pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.173"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0555770b97e07f3050a451a523cb986b21afb112","title":"Vectorized Radviz and Its Application to Multiple Cluster Datasets","venue":"IEEE Trans.

The resulting sensation of disturbed balance can be avoided by using stochastic stimulation patterns. Adding noise to the nervous system sometimes improves function. Small clinical trials suggest that stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) may improve symptoms in Parkinson's disease. We have investigated this claim and possible mechanisms using the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) hemilesion model of Parkinson's disease.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nAnimals were tested in the accelerating rod test and the Montoya staircase test of skilled forelimb use. In 6-OHDA hemilesioned animals, SVS improved rod performance by 56±11 s. At group level L-DOPA treatment had no effect, but positive responders improved time on rod by 60±19 s. Skilled forelimb use was not altered by SVS. To investigate how SVS may influence basal ganglia network activity, intracerebral microdialysis was employed in four regions of interest during and after SVS. In presence of the γ-amino buturic acid (GABA) transporter inhibitor NNC 711, SVS induced an increase in GABA to 150±15% of baseline in the substantia nigra (SN) of unlesioned animals, but had no effect in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), the striatum or the ventromedial thalamus (VM). Dopamine release remained stable in all areas, as did GABA and amine concentrations in the SN of unstimulated controls. Following SVS, a sustained increase in GABA concentrations was observed in the ipsilesional, but not in the contralesional SN of 6-OHDA hemilesioned rats. In contrast, L-DOPA treatment produced a similar increase of GABA in the ipsi- and contra-lesional SN.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE\nSVS improves rod performance in a rat model of Parkinson's disease, possibly by increasing nigral GABA release in a dopamine independent way. We propose that SVS could be useful for treating symptoms of Parkinson's disease.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/dd/1d/PLoS_One_2012_Jan_6_7(1)_e29308.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0555da4a756bd32ca1b528572e9d6b19961617a2","title":"Noisy Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation Promotes GABA Release in the Substantia Nigra and Improves Locomotion in Hemiparkinsonian Rats","venue":"PloS one","year":2012}

We present the minimal model of the Higgs as a pseudo-Goldstone boson in which electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically via top loop effects, all flavour problems are solved, and contributions to electroweak precision observables are below experimental bounds. Since the 5D theory is weakly coupled, we are able to fully determine the Higgs potential and other physical quantities. The lightest resonances are expected to have a mass around 2 TeV and should be discovered at the LHC. The top sector is mostly composite and deviations from Standard Model couplings are expected.","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0412089v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0412089v1.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0557221793c98dc2921b9639fed295cbd50f11e8","title":"The Minimal Composite Higgs Model","venue":"","year":2004}

Flax rust (Melampsora lini) AvrL567 avirulence proteins and the corresponding flax (Linum usitatissimum) L5, L6, and L7 resistance proteins interact directly. We determined the three-dimensional structures of two members of the AvrL567 family, AvrL567-A and AvrL567-D, at 1.4- and 2.3-A resolution, respectively. The structures of both proteins are very similar and reveal a beta-sandwich fold with no close known structural homologs. The polymorphic residues in the AvrL567 family map to the surface of the protein, and polymorphisms in residues associated with recognition differences for the R proteins lead to significant changes in surface chemical properties. Analysis of single amino acid substitutions in AvrL567 proteins confirm the role of individual residues in conferring differences in recognition and suggest that the specificity results from the cumulative effects of multiple amino acid contacts.

Freedman et al (2001) supplemented these criteria with the so-called proportion explained after notifying some drawbacks in Prentice's approach. Buyse et al (2000) framed the evaluation exercise within a meta-analytic setting, thereby overcoming difficulties that necessarily surround evaluation efforts based on a single trial. In this paper, we briefly review the meta-analytic approach for continuous outcomes. Advantages and problems are highlighted by means of two case studies, one in schizophrenia and one in ophthalmology, and a simulation study. One of the critical issues for the broad adoption of methodology like the one presented here is the availability of flexible implementations in standard statistical software.

Although the approximate or asymptotic decorrelation provided by Fourier is sufficient in many cases, its performance is inadequate in applications which employ short windows. The Vander-monde transform will therefore be useful in speech and audio processing applications, which have to use short analysis windows because the input signal varies rapidly over time. Such applications are often used on mobile devices with limited computational capacity, whereby efficient computations are of paramount importance. Implementation of the Vandermonde transform has, however , turned out to be a considerable effort: it requires advanced numerical tools whose performance is optimized for complexity and accuracy.

The vacua are distributed into universality classes protected by topology in momentum space. The vacua whose manifold of fermion zero modes has co-dimension 3 are of special interest because in the low-energy corner the fermionic excitations become the Weyl relativistic chiral fermions, while the dynamical bosonic collective modes of the fermionic vacuum interact with the chiral fermions as the effective gravity and gauge fields. The relativistic invariance, the chirality of fermions, the gauge and gravity fields, the relativistic spin, etc., are the emergent low-energy properties of the quantum vacuum with such fermion zero modes. The vacuum of the Standard Model and the vacuum of superfluid 3 He-A belong to this universality class and thus they are described by similar effective theories. This allows us to use this quantum liquid for the theoretical and experimental simulations of many problems related to the quantum vacuum, such as the chiral anomaly and the cosmological constant problems. 1 Universality classes of fermionic vacua 1.1 Fermion zero modes of quantum vacuum All known elementary particles and gauge bosons are either massless or have the mass which is extremely small compared to the Planck energy scale. This suggests that all the particles and fields originate from the fermionic or bosonic zero modes of the quantum vacuum. If so, our goal must be to describe and classify the possible zero modes of quantum vacua and their interactions. This does not require the knowledge of the exact 'microscopic' (trans-Planckian) structure of the quantum vacuum and can be done on the phenomenological grounds. The classification of quantum vacua in terms of their zero modes is simplified if we assume that only fermions are fundamental, while the bosons are composite representing the collective modes of the fermionic quantum vacuum. As distinct from the symmetry classification of the vacuum states, it is the topology of the propagator of the fermionic field which distinguishes between different quantum vacua.

Communication techniques such as Tell-Show-Do and parents' interference management were the basic elements of the educational scenario on which the VP was based. An evaluation of the simulation was made by 103 dental students in their fourth year of study. Two groups were formed: an experimental group which was exposed to the simulation (n=52) and a control group which did not receive the simulation (n=51). At the end, both groups were asked to complete a knowledge questionnaire and the results were compared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA statistically significant difference between the two groups was found by applying a t test for independent samples (P<.001), showing a positive learning effect from the VP. The majority of the participants evaluated the aspects of the simulation very positively while 69% (36/52) of the simulation group expressed their preference for using this module as an additional teaching tool.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrated that a pediatric dentistry VP built in a virtual world offers significant learning potential when used as a supplement to the traditional teaching techniques.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05662a1151cd70606434d6dad114a4b5fba0d716","title":"Design and Evaluation of a Simulation for Pediatric Dentistry in Virtual Worlds","venue":"Journal of medical Internet research","year":2013}

Current environment including life style coupled with genetic programming have been attributed to the rising incidence of hypertension. Besides, environmental conditions during perinatal development such as maternal malnutrition can program changes in the integration among renal, neural, and endocrine system leading to hypertension. This phenomenon is termed phenotypic plasticity and refers to the adjustment of a phenotype in response to environmental stimuli without genetic change, following a novel or unusual input during development. Human and animal studies indicate that fetal exposure to an adverse maternal environment may alter the renal morphology and physiology that contribute to the development of hypertension. Recently, it has been shown that the maternal protein restriction alter the central control of SAH by a mechanism that include respiratory dysfunction and enhanced sympathetic-respiratory coupling at early life, which may contribute to adult hypertension. This review will address the new insights on the maternal diet induced-hypertension that include the potential role of the phenotypic plasticity, specifically the perinatal protein malnutrition, and sympathetic-respiratory overactivity.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/f4/6d/fphys-06-00345.PMC4656835.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05677582a042abd13ee5f29fc8d0e8215e281413","title":"New Insights on the Maternal Diet Induced-Hypertension: Potential Role of the Phenotypic Plasticity and Sympathetic-Respiratory Overactivity","venue":"Front.

In perfect capital markets, corporate behavior should be insensitive to shareholder horizon, but when investment opportunities are not well valued by the market, shareholder horizon matters. We first present a simple framework to show that shareholder horizon should be looked at in conjunction with stock misvaluation. We build on this insight to design a novel empirical strategy to assess the impact of investor short-termism. Consistent with our simple framework, we find that, when a firm is undervalued, the presence of more short-term investors is associated with bigger shareholder payout, less equity issue, less external financing, and as a result, less investment and less R&D spending. Under our interpretation, long-term investors are not more involved in corporate governance, yet, they affect corporate policy.","pdfUrls":["http://www.efmaefm.org/0EFMAMEETINGS/EFMA%20ANNUAL%20MEETINGS/2010-Aarhus/EFMA2010_0159_fullpaper.pdf","http://www.fma.org/Hamburg/Papers/Derrien_FMA_Europe.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05690df108c37a7853af0c31ff5b2e0aadbebf67","title":"Investor Horizons and Corporate Policies","venue":"","year":2009}

Theoretical predictions are based on heterogeneity of individuals in terms of social and risk preferences. We modelize preferences according to the inequity aversion model of Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and to the assumption of constant relative risk aversion. Risk aversion is significantly and negatively correlated with the contribution decision of first movers. Second movers with sufficiently high advantageous inequity aversion free-ride less and reciprocate more than others. Both results are predicted by our model. Nevertheless, no effect of disadvantageous inequity aversion of first movers is found in the data while theory predicted it. Our results underline the importance of taking into account the order of agents' play to correctly understand which type of preferences influences cooperation in voluntary contribution mechanisms. They suggest that individuals' behavior can be consistent between different experimental games.

OFDM is a very popular approach to equalize the temporal intersymbol interferences caused by frequency-selective channels. Using MIMO systems, it is possible to increase the channel capacity while keeping the transmission bandwidth and the transmit power. One of the most serious drawbacks of OFDM are high peaks of the transmit signal. Processing such a transmit signal with a nonlinear power amplifier at the transmitter front-end causes signal clipping, which in turn generates out-of-band radiation. In order to avoid the disturbance of adjacent transmission channels, this out-of-band radiation has to be strictly avoided. Considering multi-antenna transmitters, the issue of out-of-band radiation gets even more serious. For this reason, a transmitter-sided algorithmic control of the signal peaks, also known as peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) reduction algorithm, is desirable. PAR reduction algorithms for single-antenna transmitters are well known in literature. However, there is a particular need for PAR reduction schemes, especially designed for MIMO systems. In this thesis, the schemes based on multiple signal representation , which are selected mapping (SLM) and partial transmit sequences (PTS), are extended to multi-antenna systems.

Elderly cognitively-impaired psychiatric inpatients (N = 28) participated in an 8-week randomized control trial using a crossover design. Once a week, subjects were assigned either to music therapy or a control treatment (age-appropriate movie). The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) assessed cognition 3 times every week: prior to the intervention, immediately after the mid-afternoon intervention, and the morning following the intervention. Comparisons between conditions included weekly changes in individual subject's MMSE scores from weekly baseline to both the 2 follow-ups and the following week's baseline. Significant next morning improvements in MMSE scores were found within intent-to-treat music therapy cases as compared to control cases. While all the subjects in this study were cognitively impaired, only 17 had been formally diagnosed with dementia. Based on a Cochrane Collaboration suggestion that music therapy studies within geriatric populations look specifically at the treatment of dementia, a final generalized estimating equation model considered only the change within the 17 dementia-diagnosed subjects. Immediately after the intervention, MMSE scores in the dementia-diagnosed subjects assigned to music therapy improved 2.00 points compared to the dementia-diagnosed subjects assigned to the control group (Z = 1.99, p < .05). Next-day MMSE test scores in the dementia-diagnosed subjects assigned to music therapy showed average improvements of 3.69 points compared to the control subjects (Z = 3.38, p < .001). By the following week, no significant cognitive differences remained between the two groups. It was concluded that a reasonable music therapy intervention facilitated by a trained and accredited music therapist significantly improved next-morning cognitive functioning among dementia patients. With many music therapists working in geriatric settings, more research is justified to both replicate this study and provide better guidance into the effective use of music therapy in the treatment of dementia.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/056af4c46e4bceb5773c52ab58bce742ff3e48c4","title":"The temporal limits of cognitive change from music therapy in elderly persons with dementia or dementia-like cognitive impairment: a randomized controlled trial.","venue":"Journal of music therapy","year":2007}

It appears likely that this beneficial effect of alcohol will soon be extended to some mental disorders. Although data on psychosis and mood and anxiety disorders are currently lacking, it appears that the relative risks of developing ischaemic stroke and Alzheimer's or vascular dementia are also lowered by moderate alcohol consumption. Such findings are still tentative because of the inherent methodological problems involved in population-based epidemiological studies, and it is unclear whether the benefit can be ascribed to alcohol itself or to other constituents specific to wine such as polyphenols. Plausible biological mechanisms have been advanced for the protective effect of alcohol and wine against CHD, many of which will also play roles in their protective actions against cerebrovascular disease and dementia. The specific antioxidant properties of wine polyphenols may be particularly important in preventing Alzheimer's disease. Because of the substantially unpredictable risk of progression to problem drinking and alcohol abuse, the most sensible advice to the general public is that heavy drinkers should drink less or not at all, that abstainers should not be indiscriminately encouraged to begin drinking for health reasons, and that light to moderate drinkers need not change their drinking habits for health reasons, except in exceptional circumstances.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/056f8516bb67aa7fb3ed4e57961ecdf89a04a11a","title":"Alcohol, wine and mental health: focus on dementia and stroke.","venue":"Journal of psychopharmacology","year":2004}

In this article we present numerical simulations with the software package TRAPRO. We consider a system of convection-diffusion-reaction-equations, that we coupled by their reaction terms. We present a new discretization method that improves the explicit discretization for the transport-and reaction-term. The method should replace the previous decoupled implicit method with an operator-splitting method by an explicit coupled method between transport and reaction. For analyzing the method we reduce our model to a simpler system of convection-reaction-equations. The numerical results will be compared with the exact solutions. With a test example we illustrate results of our recent research on this subject. 1. Introduction. The main motivation for our research is the question of how to find a suitable disposal for radioactive waste. To answer this question we have developed a software package for testing possible scenarios. We have further developed suitable discretizations and appropriate solvers, cf. [6], [7] and [9]. The model is based on a convection-diffusion-reaction-equation with kinetic sorp-tion, see [3] and [6]. The present numerical methods, cf. [9], are standard methods of 1st order. For the space-discretization we use barycentric finite-volume methods of 1st order, cf. [2] with an upwind scheme for the convection-term, cf. [5]. For the time-discretization we use a backward-Euler-method of 1st order. As a nonlinear solver we take a Newton-method, that uses a linear solver with a biconjugate gradient method. The biconjugate gradient method uses the multigrid method as solver. The first improvements towards higher order methods were achieved in the time-discretization. We replaced the implicit first order methods by Runge-Kutta-methods of 2nd order. For the reaction-term we use an operator-splitting-method of 1st order. In our recent work on higher order discretization we have tried to find an exact solution for the transport-reaction-term and to solve them explicitly. We could solve the problem by an operator-splitting method or by a coupled solving of transport and reaction with finite volumes. The development of these methods and the numerical calculations are described in this paper. Numerical experiments indicate the advantages of the new method. In Section 2 we describe the mathematical model. In Section 3 we reduce it to a simpler model. The coupled explicit method is described in Section 4, the application to a system of 2 equations is explained in Section 5. The numerical methods are explained in Section 6. …","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45346-6_52","http://www.iam.fmph.uniba.sk/amuc/_contributed/algo2002/geiser/geiser.pdf","http://pc2.iam.fmph.uniba.sk/amuc/_contributed/algo2002/geiser/geiser.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0574144b08e1a3e80568384ac6a4bb6c7624f044","title":"Numerical Simulation of a Model for Transport and Reaction of Radionuclides","venue":"LSSC","year":2001}

The strong ramp SS schemes do not leak out any part of a secret explicitly even in the case that some information about the secret leaks out from some set of shares, and hence, they are more desirable than the weak ramp SS schemes. In this paper, it is shown that for any feasible general access structure, a strong ramp SS scheme can be constructed from a partially decryptable ramp SS scheme, which can be considered as a kind of SS scheme with plural secrets. As a byproduct, it is pointed out that threshold ramp SS schemes based on Shamir's polynomial interpolation method are not always strong.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipl.2005.09.012","http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0506065v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0506065","http://hirosuke.it.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pdfs/IPL-97-2-52-original.pdf","http://hirosuke.it.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pdfs/IPL-97-afv.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0506065v1.pdf","http://hirosuke.it.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/files/ABST/pdfs/IPL-97-afv.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0574203676d50aa66f7bafab6c9c5e536b069a43","title":"Strongly secure ramp secret sharing schemes for general access structures","venue":"Inf.

The neuropathology of purinergic P2Y12 receptors is well characterized in glia; however, their physiological role in TG neurons remains to be fully elucidated. The present study investigated the expression and function of P2Y12 receptors in rat TG neurons. P2Y12 receptor immunoreactivity was intense in the soma, dendrites, and axons, and colocalized with a pan-neuronal marker, neurofilament H, isolectin B4, and substance P. In the presence of extracellular Ca(2+), 2-methylthio-ADP (an agonist of P2Y1, 12, 13 receptors) transiently increased intracellular free Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)]i), an effect that was abolished by P2Y12 receptor antagonists. In the absence of extracellular Ca(2+), ryanodine receptor/channel inhibitors diminished the 2-methylthio-ADP-induced increases in [Ca(2+)]i. A sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor gradually increased [Ca(2+)]i, and after a plateau, application of 2-MeS-ADP induced a rapid and transient, but additive increase in [Ca(2+)]i. An adenylate cyclase inhibitor transiently increased [Ca(2+)]i, while a phosphodiesterase inhibitor prevented the 2-methylthio-ADP-induced increase in [Ca(2+)]i. Our study shows that P2Y12 receptors are expressed in TG neurons, and act via a cAMP-dependent pathway to release intracellular Ca(2+) from ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) stores.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0574b80e3dab9574747e37d1313f0c09e032c501","title":"Expression and function of purinergic P2Y12 receptors in rat trigeminal ganglion neurons.","venue":"Neuroscience research","year":2015}

We describe the range of radial shortening that occurs following a fracture of the proximal radius, as well as the short-term outcome in these patients.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nOver an 18-month period, we prospectively assessed all patients with a radiographically confirmed proximal radial fracture. Patients noted to have ipsilateral wrist pain at initial presentation underwent bilateral radiography to determine whether there was disruption of the distal radio-ulnar joint suggestive of an Essex-Lopresti lesion. Outcome was assessed after a mean of 6 (1.5-12) months using clinical and radiographic results, including the Mayo elbow score (MES) and the short musculoskeletal function assessment (SMFA) questionnaire. One patient with a Mason type-I fracture was lost to follow-up after initial presentation.\n\n\nRESULTS\n60 patients had ipsilateral wrist pain at the initial assessment of 237 proximal radial fractures. Radial shortening of ≥ 2mm (range: 2-4mm) was seen in 22 patients (mean age 48 (19-79) years, 16 females). The most frequent mechanism of injury was a fall from standing height (10/22). 21 fractures were classified as being Mason type-I or type-II, all of which were managed nonoperatively. One Mason type-III fracture underwent acute radial head replacement. Functional outcome was assessed in 21 patients. We found an excellent or good MES in 18 of the 20 patients with a Mason type-I or type-II injury.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nThe incidence of the Essex-Lopresti lesion type is possibly under-reported as there is a spectrum of injuries, and subtle disruptions often go unidentified. A full assessment of all patients with a proximal radial fracture is required in order to identify these injuries, and the index of suspicion is raised as the complexity of the fracture increases.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/1f/c3/ORT-1745-3674-82-356.PMC3235316.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0577d606438dbd6df5f38027602cfbbedfe2f70e","title":"Radial shortening following a fracture of the proximal radius","venue":"Acta orthopaedica","year":2011}

However, display may be energetically expensive and reduce the time available for foraging. These costs in turn could lower energy reserves, which could decrease survival. I examined trade-offs in male lek behavior using two methods: 1) I conducted an empirical study of how sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) males allocate time between courtship display (\" dancing \"), agonism, foraging, and inactivity in relation to female numbers both within and across days. I also measured head turning rates during these same behaviors as a proxy for visual attentiveness to the surroundings. 2) I created a stochastic-dynamic programming (SDP) model to investigate how the trade-off between reproductive success and survival (mediated by body condition) affects male reproductive strategies. In my empirical study, I found that the proportion of males engaged in display increased significantly with female numbers whereas foraging decreased significantly with female numbers both within and across days. This indicates that males increase display at the expense of reduced foraging time at periods of high female attendance. In addition, during display, males turned their head only half as frequently as during other activities, which suggests reduced visual attentiveness during display and the potential for increased predation risk. In the SDP ! ! model, initial body condition largely determines the optimal seasonal breeding strategy. Males with initially lower body condition are predicted to forage early in the season, maintain lower condition throughout the season, and delay the onset of maximum display effort compared to males with initially higher condition. The results of the two studies suggest that male lek behavior is constrained by both the costs of display and the survival cost of maintaining body condition. !\"# # ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would especially like to thank my adviser Dr. Robert Gibson for providing advice, resources, and support over the course of my time at UNL as a student in his lab. statistical advice, the USFWS staff at VNWR for logistical support, the NGPC for capture permits, and the Nelson family of Valentine, NE for permission to use the Nelson lek site.

He is currently wrapping up his master's degree in CS and will soon be starting on his doctorate. He is also a recent Debian convert. 1. The effort to develop the Internet Protocol Next Generation was started in 1994 [2]. One of the fields carried forward from IPv4 was the version field. IPv4 used version number 4; another protocol, the Internet Stream Protocol, was already using version number 5. Thus, the first available version number was 6 and the name \" IPv6 \" was born. The follow-on to IPv4, IPv6 has not yet seen wide deployment. This article discusses the motivations for IPv6, its history, its design criteria, and some of its new features. Finally, a look at future deployment and applications is presented. IPv6 is the network protocol follow-on to the popular IPv4, 1 the network transport layer of the TCP/IP protocol that runs the majority of the Internet. IPv6 was designed with the knowledge of all of IPv4' s shortcomings and with 20 good years of experience running the Internet. IPv6 addresses the Internet' s current and anticipated problems with elegant solutions. IPv4 IPv4 was designed in 1980 to replace the already archaic NCP protocol on the ARPANET as it then existed. When first deployed, fewer than 1,000 computers were linked by IPv4. Who would have guessed that a 32-bit address space whose theoretical maximum connectivity was about two billion computers would not be enough? Two decades after its first implementation, the explosive growth of the Internet exposed some of IPv4' s limitations, the most serious of which is limited address space. The problems of expanding the address space drove the design of IPv6. IPv4 had several other problems, however:","pdfUrls":["https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/1027-andress0504.pdf","http://www.usenix.org./system/files/login/articles/1027-andress0504.pdf","http://usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/1027-andress0504.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0578f91a88792aa3a54d9f8719bf1fb1ab286d4f","title":"Ipv6: the next Internet Protocol","venue":"","year":2005}

The aim of this paper is to develop hypothesis testing based on likelihood ratio test in fuzzy environment, where it is supposed that both hypotheses under study and sample data are fuzzy. The main idea is to employ Zadeh's extension principle. In this regard, a pair of non-linear programming problems is exploited toward obtaining membership function of likelihood ratio test statistic. Afterwards, the membership function is compared with critical value of the test in order to assess acceptability of the fuzzy null hypothesis under consideration. In this step, two distinct procedures are applied. In the first procedure, a ranking method for fuzzy numbers is utilized to make an absolute decision about acceptability of fuzzy null hypothesis. From a different point of view, in the second procedure, membership degrees of fuzzy null hypothesis acceptance and rejection are first derived using resolution identity and then, a relative decision is made on fuzzy null hypothesis acceptance or rejection based on some arbitrary decision rules. Flexibility of the proposed approach in testing fuzzy hypothesis with vague data is presented using some numerical examples.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-012-0977-3","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hadi_Moheb-Alizadeh/publication/257432411_Fuzzy_hypothesis_testing_with_vague_data_using_likelihood_ratio_test/links/0f317531f467d7d364000000.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0579e3b1d73970623d2e787c20c333d2cf6dc17e","title":"Fuzzy hypothesis testing with vague data using likelihood ratio test","venue":"Soft Comput.","year":2013}

This study investigated differences in the central mRNA expression of seven dopamine genes (Drd1, Drd2, Drd3, Drd4, Drd5, TH, and DAT) between high active C57/LJ (n=17) male mice and low active C3H/HeJ (n=20) male mice, and between mice with access to a running wheel and without running wheel access within strain. Mice were housed with running wheels interfaced with a computer for 21 days with distance and duration recorded every 24 h. On day 21, the striatum and nucleus accumbens were removed during the active period (approximately 9 pm) for dopaminergic analysis. On average, the C57L/J mice with wheels ran significantly farther (10.25+/-1.37 km/day vs. 0.01+/-0.09 km/day, p<0.001), longer (329.73+/-30.52 min/day vs. 7.81+/-6.32 min/day, p<0.001), and faster (31.27+/-3.13 m/min vs. 11.81+/-1.08 m/min, p<0.001) than the C3H/HeJ mice with wheels over the 21 day period. No differences in gene expression were found between mice in either strain with wheels and those without wheels suggesting that access to running wheels did not alter dopaminergic expression. In contrast, relative expression for two dopamine genes was significantly lower in the C57L/J mice compared to the C3H/HeJ mice. These results indicate that decreased dopaminergic functioning is correlated with increased activity levels in C57L/J mice and suggests that D1-like receptors as well as tyrosine hydroxylase (an indicator of dopamine production), but not D2-like receptors may be associated with the regulation of physical activity in inbred mice.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/057f08c4864f3d0a52f89f1dc0af974ddd00ee77","title":"Altered dopaminergic profiles: implications for the regulation of voluntary physical activity.","venue":"Behavioural brain research","year":2009}

Because the number of protein structures with unknown function is mushrooming, however, we asked here whether such comparisons could be improved by focusing narrowly on the key functional features of protein structures, as defined by the Evolutionary Trace (ET). Therefore a series of algorithms was built to (a) extract local motifs (3D templates) from protein structures based on ET ranking of residue importance; (b) to assess their geometric and evolutionary similarity to other structures; and (c) to transfer enzyme annotation whenever a plurality was reached across matches. Whereas a prototype had only been 80% accurate and was not scalable, here a speedy new matching algorithm enabled large-scale searches for reciprocal matches and thus raised annotation specificity to 100% in both positive and negative controls of 49 enzymes and 50 non-enzymes, respectively-in one case even identifying an annotation error-while maintaining sensitivity ( approximately 60%). Critically, this Evolutionary Trace Annotation (ETA) pipeline requires no prior knowledge of functional mechanisms. It could thus be applied in a large-scale retrospective study of 1218 structural genomics enzymes and reached 92% accuracy. Likewise, it was applied to all 2935 unannotated structural genomics proteins and predicted enzymatic functions in 320 cases: 258 on first pass and 62 more on second pass. Controls and initial analyses suggest that these predictions are reliable. Thus the large-scale evolutionary integration of sequence-structure-function data, here through reciprocal identification of local, functionally important structural features, may contribute significantly to de-orphaning the structural proteome.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/e9/41/PLoS_ONE_2008_May_7_3(5)_e2136.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/057f2508f7e7eeacc73a27e812e7766fe1cfeeb0","title":"De-Orphaning the Structural Proteome through Reciprocal Comparison of Evolutionarily Important Structural Features","venue":"PloS one","year":2008}

We investigated in brain slices whether rat hippocampal astrocytes respond to acetylcholine synaptically released by an extrinsic pathway. We stimulated the stratum oriens/alveus, which contains cholinergic afferents from the septum and diagonal band of Broca, and recorded whole-cell membrane currents and intracellular Ca2+ levels of astrocytes located in the hippocampal stratum oriens. Nerve-fiber stimulation evoked a long-lasting inward current and increased the Ca2+ levels in astrocytes. Both astrocytic responses were abolished by tetrodotoxin or Cd2+ and were increased by 4-aminopyridine, indicating that the responses were attributable to synaptically released neurotransmitter. The inward current was inhibited by glutamate transporter antagonists, indicating that it was attributable to the electrogenic glutamate transporter activity. The synaptically evoked intracellular Ca2+ elevations were not affected by glutamate receptor antagonists but were abolished by atropine, indicating that they were mediated by muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Thapsigargin prevented the Ca2+ elevation but did not modify the inward current, indicating that the Ca2+ signal was attributable to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. These results indicate that hippocampal astrocytes respond to acetylcholine released by synaptic terminals. The synaptically released acetylcholine acts on muscarinic receptors, mobilizing Ca2+ from the intracellular stores. Different regions in the recorded astrocytes showed independent stimulus-induced Ca2+ variations, suggesting the existence of subcellular domains in the astrocytic responses evoked by the synaptic cholinergic activity. Therefore, our results show the existence of cholinergic neuron-astrocyte signaling and suggest that astrocytes are a target of axonal inputs from different brain areas.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0584f16a07e3b5fa2e74b0d18eb17fb797d6380e","title":"Synaptically released acetylcholine evokes Ca2+ elevations in astrocytes in hippocampal slices.","venue":"The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","year":2002}

This is a non-rigid registration of the left ventricle originally for the visual and quantitative analysis of tomographic myocardial perfusion scintigrams. In this scheme the maximal-count circumferential profiles of well-defined short- and long-axis planes are plotted to a map showing the distribution of the perfusion tracer onto a two-dimensional polar representation. The usual coronary artery distribution is often indicated on the PMs of SPECT studies by referring to the regions of the three main coronary branches, nevertheless, the individual variations may differ extensively. We set out to develop an Access (Microsoft)-based computer program that permits an integrated evaluation of the imaging results (coronary angiography, echocardiography and SPECT) on patients with coronary artery disease. This semi-quantitative registration of the coronary tree to a PM focused on the relation between the supplying coronary branches and the myocardial regions of the 16-segment left ventricular evaluating model. All the recorded anatomical and functional data were related to these 16 left ventricular segments, which allowed the direct comparison and holistic synthesis of the results. Two projections were taken into consideration for generation of the coronary PM: from the right anterior oblique projections, the left anterior descendent (LAD)/right coronary artery (RCA) border was assessed through the comparison of the left and right coronary angiograms. The terminations of the visually detected end-arteries showed the separation of the myocardial beds supplied by the two branches. The border of the myocardial beds on the polar map was determined on the \"vertical axis\" of the local coordinate system. The RCA/ left circumflex (LCx) separation can be determined from the left anterior oblique view. In this projection, the left ventricular septal edge was delineated by the LAD, while the LCx indicated the lateral epicardial surface. The individual coronary artery circulation was typified from among 12 variations in the Holistic Coronary Care program. With this determination of the individual coronary circulation, the lesion-associated segments are generated automatically by the software. The lesion-associated regions are defined as the myocardial bed of a diseased artery distal to the lesion. The PMs generated from the coronary angiographic results were compared with those of 99Tc-labelled MIBI single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in order to test the accuracy of the localizing method. The overlap between the segments associated with the coronary lesion and the stress perfusion defects (<80% relative MIBI activity during stress tests) was analyzed in 10 patients with (sub)total coronary occlusion after myocardial infarction. The distributions of the segments with stress perfusion defects on MIBI SPECT gave positive and negative predictive values of coronary occlusion of 0.94 and 0.8, respectively. According to the 16-segment wall motion analysis by echocardiography, the positive and negative predictive values of coronary occlusion for wall motion abnormality were 0.82 and 0.76, respectively. While the distal part of the subtended region usually demonstrated a higher degree perfusion abnormality than the proximal part, the high positive predictive value proved that, during the stress condition, the perfusion defect could be detected in practically all the subtended regions. The low negative predictive value of the coronary lesion for the wall motion abnormality was associated with the remodeling of the entire left ventricle.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compmedimag.2007.06.008"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0587984cc3ac613ffd8f41dc65a0a899747db7a2","title":"Holistic polar map for integrated evaluation of cardiac imaging results","venue":"Comp.

Rats were divided into four groups: normal, Cit, CLP, and CLP+Cit. The CLP group and CLP+Cit group were separated into 6-, 12-, and 24-hour groups, according to the time points of sacrifice after surgery. Intragastric administration of L-citrulline was applied to rats in Cit and CLP+Cit groups before surgery. Serum AST and ALT levels and levels of MDA, SOD, NO, and iNOS in the liver tissues were evaluated. Plasma concentrations of Cit and Arg were assessed using HPLC-MS/MS. Serum concentrations of cytokines and chemokines were calculated by Luminex. Results showed SOD activities of CLP+Cit groups were significantly higher than that of CLP groups, contrasting with the MDA and NO levels which were significantly lower in CLP+Cit groups than in CLP groups.

The StAR and PBR fusion proteins were trafficking to the mitochondria as expected, but the endozepine fusion protein was not localized to the mitochondria indicating that it was not biologically active. Data were obtained indicating that PBR forms aggregates in the mitochondrial membrane. Energy transfer between PBR fusion proteins was dose and time dependent, but there was no effect induced by PK11195 ligand binding or pharmacologic activation of PKA or PKC second messenger pathways.

In 2009 the OLCF began compiling a list of candidate applications that were to be the vanguards of Titan—the first codes that would be adapted to take full advantage of its mixed architecture. This list was gleaned from research done for the 2009 OLCF report Preparing for Exascale: OLCF Application Requirements and Strategy as well as from responses from current and former INCITE awardees. Initially 50 applications were considered, but this list was eventually pared down to a set of six critical codes from various domain sciences: S3D, used by a team led by Jacqueline Chen of Sandia National Laboratories, is a direct numerical simulation code that models combustion.

Simultaneous resection of primary colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and synchronous liver metastases (SLMs) is subject of debate with respect to morbidity in comparison to staged resection. The aim of this study was to evaluate our initial experience with this approach. Methods. Five patients with primary CRC and a clinical diagnosis of SLM underwent combined laparoscopic colorectal and liver surgery. Patient and tumor characteristics, operative variables, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated retrospectively. Results. The primary tumor was located in the colon in two patients and in the rectum in three patients. The SLM was solitary in four patients and multiple in the remaining patient. Surgical approach was total laparoscopic (2 patients) or hand-assisted laparoscopic (3 patients). The midline umbilical or transverse suprapubic incision created for the hand port and/or extraction of the specimen varied between 5 and 10 cm. Median operation time was 303 (range 151-384) minutes with a total blood loss of 700 (range 200-850) mL. Postoperative hospital stay was 5, 5, 9, 14, and 30 days. An R0 resection was achieved in all patients. Conclusions. From this initial single-center experience, simultaneous laparoscopic colorectal and liver resection appears to be feasible in selected patients with CRC and SLM, with satisfying short-term results.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0591703c2bc2da82ab7a1a82543a2ae8d7781ad4","title":"Initial Experiences of Simultaneous Laparoscopic Resection of Colorectal Cancer and Liver Metastases","venue":"HPB surgery : a world journal of hepatic, pancreatic and biliary surgery","year":2012}

We present a computational extension of the Bechdel test: A popular tool to assess if a movie contains a male gender bias, by looking for two female characters who discuss about something besides a man. We provide the tools to quantify Bechdel scores for both genders, and we measure them in movie scripts and large datasets of dialogues between users of MySpace and Twitter. Comparing movies and users of social media, we find that movies and Twitter conversations have a consistent male bias, which does not appear when analyzing MySpace. Furthermore, the narrative of Twitter is closer to the movies that do not pass the Bechdel test than to those that pass it. We link the properties of movies and the users that share trailers of those movies. Our analysis reveals some particulari-ties of movies that pass the Bechdel test: Their trailers are less popular, female users are more likely to share them than male users, and users that share them tend to interact less with male users. Based on our datasets, we define gender independence measurements to analyze the gender biases of a society , as manifested through digital traces of online behavior. Using the profile information of Twitter users, we find larger gender independence for urban users in comparison to rural ones. Additionally, the asymmetry between genders is larger for parents and lower for students. Gender asymmetry varies across US states, increasing with higher average income and latitude. This points to the relation between gender inequality and social, economical, and cultural factors of a society, and how gender roles exist in both fictional narratives and public online dialogues.","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0163","http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/download/8070/8113","http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8070","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.0163v1.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0593ddf9e6eacf0a8be86cdcfef45154000545cf","title":"Gender Asymmetries in Reality and Fiction: The Bechdel Test of Social Media","venue":"ICWSM","year":2014}

However, efficacy of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus was also analysed on different growth parameters like plant height, shoot biomass and root biomass after 75 days of inoculation. On comparison among the two hosts, Hordeum vulgare was proved to be better. The results indicated that AM fungal spore population and colonization levels were substantially enhanced by the application of tea residue as compared to control.

INTRODUCTION Present world demands the production of high quality food in a most sustainable way causing least damage possible to the ecosystem. The productivity of agricultural systems is influenced by the cultural practices employed by man. Today, fertilizers and pesticides are being used at high levels in the intensive production of plants. A cheap and non destructive means of achieving high productivity rests on the establishment of a viable low input farming system. However, in order to implement such a plan, we must develop plant systems that can efficiently scavenge and utilize soil nutrients present at low levels. The symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have a major impact on the functioning and stability of any ecosystem. The role of AM inocula in agriculture may be expressed not only by the acquisition of nutrients by host plant, but also by reducing the use of applied fertilizers and pesticides.","pdfUrls":["http://www.wiloludjournal.com/ojs/index.php/cjBiosci/article/viewFile/391/pdf_96/"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/059434b7f9a63a0978d91a3aa9e605fca3ebfb9f","title":"Inoculum Production of Endomycorrhizal Fungi: Effect of Hosts and Substrate in Rapid Culturing of Glomus Mosseae","venue":"","year":2012}

Consciousness was upon him before he could get out of the way; not for him the slow, gracious wandering from the halls of sleep, but a summary, forcible ejection. He lay sprawled, too wicked to move, spewed up like a broken spider-crab on the tarry shingle of the morning. The light did him harm, but not as much as looking at things did; he resolved, having done it once, never to move his eyeballs again. A dusty thudding in his head made the scene before him beat like a pulse. His mouth had been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night, and then as its mausoleum. During the night, too, he'd somehow been on a crosscountry run and then been expertly beaten up by secret police. He felt bad. In this chapter, we will prove that given a set P of n points in IR d , one can reduce the dimension of the points to k = O(ε −2 log n) and distances are 1 ± ε reserved. Surprisingly, this reduction is done by randomly picking a subspace of k dimensions and projecting the points into this random subspace. One way of thinking about this result is that we are \" compressing \" the input of size nd (i.e., n points with d coordinates) into size O(nε −2 log n), while (approximately) preserving distances. 17.1 The Brunn-Minkowski inequality For a set A ⊆ IR d , an a point p ∈ IR d , let A + p denote the translation of A by p.

The phosphopantetheinyl transferase of Aspergillus fumigatus, encoded by the essential gene pptB, has previously been identified as a potential antifungal target. This study investigated the function of its orthologue in C. albicans, PPT2/C1_09480W by placing one allele under the control of the regulatable MET3 promoter, and deleting the remaining allele. The phenotypes of this conditional null mutant showed that, as in A. fumigatus, the gene PPT2 is essential for growth in C. albicans, thus fulfilling one aspect of an efficient antifungal target. The catalytic activity of Ppt2 as a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and the acyl carrier protein Acp1 as a substrate were demonstrated in a fluorescence transfer assay, using recombinant Ppt2 and Acp1 produced and purified from E.coli. A fluorescence polarisation assay amenable to high-throughput screening was also developed. Therefore we have identified Ppt2 as a broad-spectrum novel antifungal target and developed tools to identify inhibitors as potentially new antifungal compounds.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/e2/7b/pone.0143770.PMC4659657.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0594b395b7f84682f6015677fd73a0efc4fc5d2b","title":"Characterisation of the Candida albicans Phosphopantetheinyl Transferase Ppt2 as a Potential Antifungal Drug Target","venue":"PloS one","year":2015}

The Lodz province is characterized by the highest mortality rates in Poland. The SEYLLp (Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per living person) and the SEYLLd (per death) indices were used to determine years of life lost. Joinpoint models were used to analyze time trends.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn 2010, deaths due to external causes constituted 6.0% of the total number of deaths. The standardized death rate (SDR) due to external causes was 110.0 per 100,000 males and was five times higher than for females (22.0 per 100,000 females). In 2010, the SEYLLp due to external causes was 3746 per 100,000 males and 721 per 100,000 females. Among males, suicides and traffic accidents were the most common causes of death (the values of the SEYLLp were: 1098 years and 887 years per 100,000 people, respectively). Among females, the SEYLLp values were 183 years due to traffic accidents and 143 years due to suicides (per 100,000 people).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA decrease in the number of years of life lost due to external causes is much higher among females. The authors observe that a growing number of suicides contribute to an increase in the value of the SEYLLp index. This directly contributes to over-mortality of males due to external causes. The analysis of the years of life lost focuses on the social and economic aspects of premature mortality due to external causes.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/55/e1/pone.0096830.PMC4014557.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05957e89f083684c97d3ebcc69cf8f8b8bb19038","title":"Years of Life Lost Due to External Causes of Death in the Lodz Province, Poland","venue":"PloS one","year":2014}

In April 2010, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) published new guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of concussions in student athletes.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nTo determine the number of concussions that occurred on 3 collegiate Division I military academy football teams prior to and following recent changes in the NCAA concussion management policy.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nDescriptive epidemiology study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nInjury reports were reviewed from 3 Division I military academy football teams. The number of concussions that occurred over the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 seasons, including those sustained in practice and game situations, was determined for each team. Incidence rates were compared using the exact binomial method.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe combined concussion incidence rate doubled from 0.57 per 1000 athlete exposures in the 2009-2010 season to 1.16 per 1000 athlete exposures in the 2010-2011 season (incidence rate ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.2-3.55; P = 0.01). The combined numbers of concussions for the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 seasons were 23 (40,481 exposures) and 42 (36,228), respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe combined incidence rate of concussions for the 2010-2011 season doubled from the previous season after the implementation of new NCAA policies on concussion management. While the institution of a more formalized concussion plan on the part of medical staff is one possible factor, another may have been the increased recognition and reporting on the part of players and coaches after the rule change.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0596cb38df981471f5c8bdf9563b5fb9ec30d2e8","title":"Reported Concussion Rates for Three Division I Football Programs","venue":"Sports health","year":2014}

Our system consists in three phases. The first phase is called transformation which is composed of three steps; binary codification of DNA sequence, Fourier Transform and Power Spectrum Signal Processing. The second phase is called approximation. This phase is empowered by the use of Multi Library Wavelet Neural Networks (MLWNN).The third phase is called classification which is realized by applying the algorithm of hierarchical classification. The results of this contribution are more interesting in comparison with some others works, in terms of rate classification using Eukaryotic organisms database.

Some international organizations, aiming to contribute to these reforms, have given special attention to education and tried to help countries with their deficiencies in teaching, testing and evaluation systems. The PISA exams, one of the international exams, give the opportunity to countries to check regularly to what extent they approach their educational goals in basic education and share the results and evaluation of the factors affecting their education systems. TALIS is also one of these exams that identifies problems and develops suggestions for solving these problems on some sub-areas. The UNESCO IIEP and EU have done similar studies. According to the assessments and reports prepared by the aforementioned organizations, the school administrators in the school system, along with other factors, play an important role in the academic success of student. In this study, it is aimed to develop some recommendations on selection and education process of school administrators for improving the quality of education and academic achievement in the light of exam results and research reports. PREFACE The schools are open systems. As with any other system, the school system also has inputs, processes, outputs, feedback, and there are subsystems interact with its environment. If we consider \" process \" , one of the subsystems , we can encounter its subsystems which are based on four basis in cycle; these are management, education, cultural, and politics. According to reports prepared as a result of international exams, surveys and assessments, the most important factors that affect academic success in the educational process, the administration and faculty, school principals and teachers that come to the fore. In this study; the \"school management\" that affects and increases student academic success and the implications for its development is selected as a main problem and tried to be clarified the results obtained, evaluation findings, and proposals on the subject.

Earlier analyses by Korf [11] and Joslin and Roach [6] were done in terms of the topology of the space of world states. More recent analyses by Barrett and Weld [1] and Veloso and Blythe [14] were done in terms of the nature of the planner. In this paper, we will argue that subgoal interactions are best understood in terms of the candidate sets of the plans for the individual subgoals. We will describe a generalized representation for partial plans that applies to a large class of refinement planners, and discuss the notion of mergeability and serial extensibility of these partial plans. The concepts of independence and serializability of subgoals are derived by generalizing mergeability and serial extensibility over classes of partial plans. Unlike previous work, our analysis also applies to multi-method refinement planners such as UCP [7]. We will show that all existing characterizations of serializability differ only in terms of the specific class of partial plans that they implicitly address. Finally, we will use our interaction analysis to explore factors affecting the selection of a refinement planner for a given domain.","pdfUrls":["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AIPS/1996/AIPS96-016.pdf","http://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/serial.pdf","http://www.aaai.org/Library/AIPS/1996/aips96-016.php","http://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/pub/rao/serial.ps"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/059c928dc937e17cd79dcad96923bfb6f603822d","title":"A Candidate Set Based Analysis of Subgoal Interactions in Conjunctive Goal Planning","venue":"AIPS","year":1996}

Because of the many variables which impact on the survival of organisms in foods, information in this sheet must be used as a guide only. Specific processes must be checked by the food manufacturer to ensure their product is safe. Enteric viruses other than hepatitis A virus and Norwalk-like viruses have occasionally been implicated in foodborne disease. These include: Rotaviruses, astroviruses, hepatitis E virus, picornaviruses, adenoviruses and parvoviruses. Most of the enteric viruses contain RNA rather than DNA, the exceptions being adenoviruses and parvoviruses. Foodborne enteric viruses are inert particles which do not replicate in food. They require human cells to multiply. Enteric viruses can pass through the gastro-intestinal tract and are resistant to environmental stresses, including heat and acid. Most enteric viruses are stable at pH 3.0 and in the presence of lipid solvents. They resist freezing and drying. All foodborne viruses are transmitted by the faecal-oral route and are human–specific (although animal strains of the same virus may also exist). ROTAVIRUSES Rotaviruses are the major cause of childhood gastroenteritis worldwide. In developing countries, deaths are common among children < 5 years. Although the disease occurs in all age groups, it is mild and inapparent in adults. Infection is generally not recognised as foodborne but outbreaks associated with food and water have been reported in a number of countries. Many rotaviruses can be grown in cell culture. Rotaviruses infect both humans and animals; some human strains are closely related to animal strains. Infectious dose : < 100 virus particles. Survival. Human rotavirus can survive for several weeks in river water at 20ºC and at 4ºC. Inactivation: Heating at 50ºC for 30 min reduces infectivity by 99%, and infectivity is rapidly lost at pH levels < 3.0 and > 10.0. Normal cooking temperatures should be sufficient to inactivate rotaviruses. Sources of infection: contaminated water, care-givers, foodhandlers, general adult population. Overseas Outbreaks: Between 1985-1990, 11 foodborne outbreaks involving 460 cases of rotaviral gastroenteritis were reported in New York. Seven outbreaks were associated with food-service premises. Implicated foods included salad, cold foods, shepherd's pie, and water/ice. Large-scale outbreaks of rotaviral gastroenteritis were reported in Japanese primary schools (> 3000 cases). School lunches prepared at a central facility were suspected as the vehicles but no rotavirus was isolated from foods or water. Waterborne rotaviral outbreaks have been reported in many countries, …","pdfUrls":["http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/Enteric_Viruses-Other_Than.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05a1f3a8c4a288574bce331ce77478bb91e35cc3","title":"Enteric Viruses the Organism/toxin Hepatitis E Virus","venue":"","year":2001}

The solution of the multiple measurement vectors (MMV) model is difficult. In this paper, a real-valued sparse DOA estimation algorithm based on the Khatri-Rao (KR) product called the L₁-RVSKR is proposed. The proposed algorithm is based on the sparse representation of the array covariance matrix. The array covariance matrix is transformed to a real-valued matrix via a unitary transformation so that a real-valued sparse model is achieved. The real-valued sparse model is vectorized for transforming to a single measurement vector (SMV) model, and a new virtual overcomplete dictionary is constructed according to the KR product's property. Finally, the sparse DOA estimation is solved by utilizing the idea of a sparse representation of array covariance vectors (SRACV). The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance and the low computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s16050693","http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/5/693/pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05a39b00d93818a97c2a4dc7a91dd3d5485668da","title":"The Real-Valued Sparse Direction of Arrival (DOA) Estimation Based on the Khatri-Rao Product","venue":"Sensors","year":2016}

Expression was observed at high levels in androgen-independent as compared to androgen-dependent (responsive) human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts when grown in the presence of androgens. Down-regulation of the beta 1-subunit was initiated at concentrations between 0.01 nM and 0.03 nM of the synthetic androgen R1881 after relatively long incubation times (> 24 h). Using polyclonal antibodies, the concentration of beta 1-subunit protein, but not of the alpha 1-subunit protein, was markedly reduced in androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP-FGC) cultured in the presence of androgens. In line with these observations it was found that the protein expression of total Na+,K+-ATPase in the membrane (measured by 3H-ouabain binding) was also markedly decreased. The main function of Na+,K+-ATPase is to maintain sodium and potassium homeostasis in animal cells. The resulting electrochemical gradient is facilitative for transport of several compounds over the cell membrane (for example cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent experimentally used in the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer). Here we observed that a ouabain-induced decrease of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in LNCaP-FGC cells results in reduced sensitivity of these cells to cisplatin-treatment. Surprisingly, androgen-induced decrease of Na+,K+-ATPase expression, did not result in significant protection against the chemotherapeutic agent.","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/e0/f5/Br_J_Cancer_1999_Sep_81(1)_28-36.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05a8728ebadb724c949ea3db57d55f0cef2852e7","title":"Regulation of expression of Na+,K+-ATPase in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer","venue":"British journal of cancer","year":1999}

Because of the unavailability of suitable animal models for metal allergy, the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of metal allergy has not been explored. Thus, we developed a novel mouse model for metal allergy associated with infiltration of T cells by multiple injections of palladium (Pd) plus lipopolysaccharide into the footpad. Using this model, we characterized footpad-infiltrating T cells in terms of phenotypic markers, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires and cytokine expression. CD3+ CD4+ T cells accumulated in the allergic footpads 7 days after Pd challenge. The expression levels of CD25, interleukin-2, interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor, but not interleukin-4 and interleukin-5, increased in the footpads after challenge, suggesting CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) cells locally expanded in response to Pd. Infiltrated T cells in the footpads frequently expressed AV18-1 and BV8-2 T cell receptor (TCR) chains compared with T cells in the lymph nodes and exhibited oligoclonality. T-cell clones identified from Pd-allergic mouse footpads shared identical CDR3 sequences containing AV18-1 and BV8-2. These results suggest that TCR AV18-1 and BV8-2 play dominant and critical parts in the antigen specificity of Pd-specific Th1 cells.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05afc62dcc14930569cb8f5c5b1e19d64cbccfef","title":"Characterization of T Cell Receptors of Th1 Cells Infiltrating Inflamed Skin of a Novel Murine Model of Palladium-Induced Metal Allergy","venue":"PloS one","year":2013}

In this paper, the traditional RCPSP is hence extended by a highly general model-endogenous decision on this flexible project structure.

Interestingly, thalamic contacts with interneurons constitute such a powerful synapse that even one afferent can fire interneurons, thereby driving feedforward inhibition. However, the spatial representation of this potent synapse on interneuron dendrites is poorly understood. Using Ca imaging and electron microscopy we show that an individual thalamic afferent forms multiple contacts with the interneuronal proximal dendritic arbor, preferentially near branch points. More contacts are correlated with larger amplitude synaptic responses. Each contact, consisting of a single bouton, can release up to seven vesicles simultaneously, resulting in graded and reliable Ca transients. Computational modeling indicates that the release of multiple vesicles at each contact minimally reduces the efficiency of the thalamic afferent in exciting the interneuron. This strategy preserves the spatial representation of thalamocortical inputs across the dendritic arbor over a wide range of release conditions.","pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0896627311004831","http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/scanziani/bagnall_2011.pdf","http://keck.ucsf.edu/neurograd/files/ns201afa13/100313_bagnall__scanziani11.pdf","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627311004831","http://www.med.upenn.edu/ngg/user_docs/BagnallNeuron11.pdf","http://www.keck.ucsf.edu/neurograd/files/ns201afall12/sargent/102312_bagnall__scanziani11.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05b2c1b03ab57c54384d022460a8260d162a2f4b","title":"Multiple Clusters of Release Sites Formed by Individual Thalamic Afferents onto Cortical Interneurons Ensure Reliable Transmission","venue":"Neuron","year":2011}

In the model, aluminium enters the ocean by means of dust deposition. The internal oceanic processes are described by advection, mixing and reversible scavenging. The model has been evaluated against a number of selected high-quality datasets covering much of the world ocean, especially those from the West Atlantic Geotraces cruises of 2010 and 2011. Generally, the model results are in fair agreement with the observations. However, the model does not describe well the vertical distribution of dissolved Al in the North Atlantic Ocean. The model may require changes in the physical forcing and the vertical dependence of the sinking velocity of bio-genic silica to account for other discrepancies. To explore the model behaviour, sensitivity experiments have been performed, in which we changed the key parameters of the scavenging process as well as the input of aluminium into the ocean. This resulted in a better understanding of aluminium in the ocean, and it is now clear which parameter has what effect on the dissolved aluminium distribution and which processes might be missing in the model, among which boundary scavenging and biological incorporation of aluminium into diatoms. The distribution and cycling of aluminium (Al) in the ocean has received attention for a variety of reasons. Firstly, if the Al cycle is understood well, aluminium surface concentrations can be used to constrain atmospheric dust deposition fields, which are used to predict aeolian iron addition to the euphotic zone. This is important , since iron is an essential trace-nutrient for phytoplankton; thus its availability has a direct consequence on primary production and air–sea CO 2 exchange (Boyd et al., 2007; de Baar et al., 2005; Martin, 1990). Secondly, there is evidence that Al inhibits the solubility of sedi-mentary biogenic silica (Dixit et al. If less biogenic silica gets dissolved from sediments, eventually there will be less silicic acid available in the euphotic zone, which will reduce diatom production as silicon is an essential major nutrient for diatoms. Modified diatom productivity will impact ocean food webs and the export of organic carbon to the ocean's interior. For advancement in both of these fields of interest a good understanding of the Al cycle is pertinent. Currently it is assumed that the major source of Al to the ocean is …","pdfUrls":["http://www.knmi.nl/publications/fulltexts/van_hulten_2012_marsys_2239.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05b2d04c5cee9b4049319c1b308b86607a35a17f","title":"Aluminium in an ocean general circulation model compared with the West Atlantic Geotraces cruises","venue":"","year":2012}

Expansion of regulatory T cells in patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. PLoS Med 4(8): e253. distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Background Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare clonal granulomatous disease that affects mainly children. LCH can involve various tissues such as bone, skin, lung, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and the central nervous system, and is frequently responsible for functional sequelae. The pathophysiology of LCH is unclear, but the uncontrolled proliferation of Langerhans cells (LCs) is believed to be the primary event in the formation of granulomas. The present study was designed to further investigate the nature of proliferating cells and the immune mechanisms involved in the LCH granulomas. Biopsies (n ¼ 24) and/or blood samples (n ¼ 25) from 40 patients aged 0.25 to 13 y (mean 7.8 y), were studied to identify cells that proliferate in blood and granulomas. We found that the proliferating index of LCs was low (;1.9%), and we did not observe expansion of a monocyte or dendritic cell compartment in patients. We found that LCH lesions were a site of active inflammation, tissue remodeling, and neo-angiogenesis, and the majority of proliferating cells were endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and polyclonal T lymphocytes. Within granulomas, interleukin 10 was abundant, LCs expressed the TNF receptor family member RANK, and CD4 þ CD25 high FoxP3 high regulatory T cells (T-regs) represented 20% of T cells, and were found in close contact with LCs. FoxP3 þ T-regs were also expanded compared to controls, in the blood of LCH patients with active disease, among whom seven out of seven tested exhibited an impaired skin delayed-type hypersensitivity response. In contrast, the number of blood T-regs were normal after remission of LCH. Conclusions These findings indicate that LC accumulation in LCH results from survival rather than uncontrolled proliferation, and is associated with the expansion of T-regs. These data suggest that LCs may be involved in the expansion of T-regs in vivo, resulting in the failure of the …","pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/df/8e/PLoS_Med_2007_Aug_14_4(8)_e253.tar.gz"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05b615329532bdca78450fa0a88ab52032e93f24","title":"Expansion of Regulatory T Cells in Patients with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis Methods and Findings","venue":"","year":2007}

Layered volume splatting features the speed benefits of fast axis-aligned pre-classified sheet-buffer splatting while at the same time exhibiting display quality comparable to high-quality post-classified view-aligned sheet-buffer splatting. Additionally, we enhance the quality by using a more accurate approximation of the volume rendering integral. Commonly, the extinction coefficient of the volume rendering integral is approximated by the first two elements of its Taylor series expansion to allow for simple α-blending. In our approach we use the original, exponential extinction coefficient to achieve a better approximation.

It is well known that at high temperature (β < 1) the mixing time is Θ(n log n), whereas at low temperature (β > 1) it is exp(Θ(n)). Recently, Levin, Luczak and Peres considered a censored version of this dynamics, which is restricted to non-negative magnetization. They proved that for fixed β > 1, the mixing-time of this model is Θ(n log n), analogous to the high-temperature regime of the original dynamics. Furthermore, they showed cutoff for the original dynamics for fixed β < 1. The question whether the censored dynamics also exhibits cutoff remained unsettled. In a companion paper, we extended the results of Levin et al. into a complete characterization of the mixing-time for the Curie-Weiss model. Namely, we found a scaling window of order 1/ √ n around the critical temperature βc = 1, beyond which there is cutoff at high temperature. However, determining the behavior of the censored dynamics outside this critical window seemed significantly more challenging. In this work we answer the above question in the affirmative, and establish the cutoff point and its window for the censored dynamics beyond the critical window, thus completing its analogy to the original dynamics at high temperature. Namely, if β = 1 + δ for some δ > 0 with δ 2 n → ∞, then the mixing-time has order (n/δ) log(δ 2 n). The cutoff constant is 1/2 + [2(ζ 2 β/δ − 1)] −1 , where ζ is the unique positive root of g(x) = tanh(βx) − x, and the cutoff window has order n/δ.","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.0633v1.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/~eyal/papers/isingcens.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/eyal/papers/isingcens.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05b91a1df653f94d7db98c60483813d5b97e5e18","title":"Censored Glauber Dynamics for the Mean Field Ising Model","venue":"","year":2008}

Inference of such details could be instrumental for many other processes. For example, it could be used for optimized forwarding (or routing) of one's own miss stream (or content) to available proxy caches, or for making cache-aware resource management decisions. In this paper, we introduce the Cache Inference Problem (CIP) as that of inferring the characteristics of a caching agent, given the miss stream of that agent. While CIP is insolvable in its most general form, there are special cases of practical importance in which it is, including when the request stream follows an Independent Reference Model (IRM) with generalized power-law (GPL) demand distribution. To that end, we design two basic \" litmus \" tests that are able to detect the LFU and LRU replacement policies, the effective size of the cache and of the object universe, and the skewness of the GPL demand for objects. Using extensive experiments under synthetic as well as real traces, we show that our methods infer such characteristics accurately and quite efficiently, and that they remain robust even when the IRM/GPL assumptions do not hold, and even when the underlying replacement policies are not \" pure \" LFU or LRU. We demonstrate the value of our inference framework by considering example applications.","pdfUrls":["http://cs-people.bu.edu/zg/publications/LZBK07.pdf","http://www.cs.bu.edu/techreports/pdf/2006-017-cache-inference-and-applications.pdf","http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/zg/publications/LZBK07.pdf","http://people.bu.edu/zg/publications/LZBK07.pdf","http://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/best/res/papers/infocom07-cip.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2007.104"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05c29b1b2f3ee0337302a1d870add7abaf0e1a0d","title":"The Cache Inference Problem and its Application to Content and Request Routing","venue":"INFOCOM","year":2007}

The reuse and integration of heterogeneous software parts is an issue for current paradigms such as Component-Based Software Development, or Coordination Models and Languages. However, a serious limitation of current approaches is that while they provide convenient ways to describe the typed signatures of software entities, they offer a quite limited support to describe their concurrent behaviour. As a consequence, when a component is going to be reused, one can only be sure that it provides the required interface, but nothing else can be inferred about the behaviour of the component with regard to the interaction protocol required by its environment. To deal with this problem, a new discipline, Software Adaptation, is emerging. Software Adaptation promotes the use of adaptors-specific computational entities guaranteeing that software components will interact in the right way not only at the signature level, but also at the protocol and semantic levels.

To date, however, self-regulation has only been examined through self-report. The purpose of this study was to further our understanding of the association between driver characteristics, perceptions and self-regulation by monitoring the patterns of 61 drivers (mean age 80.4+/-5.5; 59% women) for one week using in-vehicle devices. Usual self-regulatory practices were assessed using the Situational Driving Frequency (SDF) and Avoidance (SDA) Scales, while perceptions were measured using the Driving Comfort and Perceived Driving Abilities Scales. Additional evidence for test-retest reliability was obtained with a separate sample of 39 older drivers. Lower comfort and poorer perceived abilities were significantly related to actual behavior: reduced exposure (km, duration) in general and at night, average and maximum radii from home and driving in challenging situations (such as on highways). Neither sex nor age was associated with any of the driving indicators. While longitudinal studies are required to determine temporality (when drivers change their behavior) and directionality (does lower comfort lead to driving restrictions or vice versa), this is the first study to demonstrate that driver perceptions are associated with actual self-regulatory practices.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05c675f817a1b402673a1dd16f7776375485fb47","title":"Examination of driving comfort and self-regulatory practices in older adults using in-vehicle devices to assess natural driving patterns.","venue":"Accident; analysis and prevention","year":2010}

Often these stages are not independent, and in particular, the detailed structure of the algorithms for implementing the system needs to take into account a variety of cost measures and options relating to system requirements, such as speed, modularity, and so on, and a variety of architectural constraints or technologies available for the implementation. For these reasons, it is important that algorithm design explore a wide variety of implementations which are found by exploiting the underlying mathematics of signal processing and taking into account a variety of cost measures. This is usually done by a design engineer with a detailed knowledge of and insight into a variety of transformations. From an input/output point of view, these transformations result in equivalent signal processing operations, but may have very different implications with regard to various cost measures. In carrying out signal processing system design, there are a few design tools currently available, but these primarily provide a convenient environment for writing 30 Sec. 2.1 Introduction / 31 programs or for testing algorithms on data. There are no systems available presently that remap signal processing algorithms, specified at a high level of abstraction, to algorithmic descriptions that are more efficient in the context of particular imple-mentational or architectural constraints. Such a design environment, if successful, might generate designs that improve on those that would be generated by experienced systems designers. A more likely and also highly desirable outcome, at least in the short run, is an environment that, with modest human intervention, achieves fast designs of signal processing algorithms that are reasonably efficient in relation to hand designs by sophisticated systems designers. The potential ability to do this in a signal processing context stems from the fact that, for signal processing, algorith-mic transformations tend to follow a clearly defined set of mathematical rules. Based on these rules, the space of equivalent algorithms can, in principle, be explored to determine those that are most efficient using appropriate cost measures. This chapter attempts to demonstrate both the feasibility and the advantages of a signal processing design environment which incorporates symbolic algorithm manipulation along with numerical processing. In particular, we focus on the problem of developing …","pdfUrls":["http://www.mangolassi.org/covell/pubs/comp_aided_alg.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05cb35b3f2152ba3e0de71913f8210708308aea4","title":"Michele M.

Agile software development methods emphasize lightweight software development. Projects within enterprise environments , however, are typically confronted with a large and complex IT landscape, where mission-critical information is at play whose criticality requires prudence regarding design and development. In many an organization, both approaches are used simultaneously. Objective: Find out which challenges the coexistence of agile methods and plan-driven development brings, and how organizations deal with those challenges. Method: We present a grounded theory of the challenges of using agile methods in traditional enterprise environments, based on a Grounded Theory research involving 21 agile practitioners from two large enterprise organizations in the Netherlands. Results: We organized the challenges under two factors: Increased landscape complexity and Lack of business involvement. For both factors, we identify successful mitigation strategies. These mitigation strategies concern the communication between the agile and traditional part of the organization, and the timing of that communication. Conclusion: Agile practices can coexist with plan-driven development. One should, however, keep in mind the context and take actions to mitigate the challenges incurred. In the last ten years the use of agile methods has become widespread [26]. While renowned methods like XP and Scrum were initially intended for projects with small teams, traditional enterprises have also become attracted by the promise of a faster time to market for their projects [9,48,16]. Agile software development methods, particularly Scrum, emphasize lightweight software development: the art of maximizing the amount of work not done. However, projects within enterprise environments are typically confronted with large and complex IT landscapes, where mission-critical information is at play whose criticality demands utter prudence regarding design and development. Plan-driven methods emphasize ''a rationalized, engineering-based approach'' [79] in which it is claimed that problems are fully specifiable and that optimal and predictable solutions exist for every problem.

Despite the advances in electronic publishing scientific articles are still published in paper print formats such as PDFs. The emergence of the Semantic Web and Linked Data environment provides new opportunities for communicating, sharing, and integrating scientific knowledge in digital formats that can overcome the limitations of the current print format, suitable only for reading by people. This paper explores the possibilities of this new environment proposing a semantic model of scholarly electronic articles in biomedical sciences. Thereby the results of scientific research can be published electronically, shared in structured, interlinked formats, enabling their crawling by software agents, facilitating semantic retrieval, knowledge reuse, validation of scientific results, identification of traces of scientific discoveries, new scientific insights, and identification of knowledge contradictions or inconsistencies. 1. INTRODUCTION The conventional communication channel for reporting scientific results is the electronic publishing of scientific articles in formats, such as PDFs. The current scholarly Web publishing environment is still an electronic metaphor of the paper print publishing environment used throughout the twentieth century. Despite numerous advances in information technology, Web electronic publishing is still based on the print text model; scientific results are still published in articles in textual format, which limits the possibilities for automatic reasoning on their contents for reuse, discovery, analysis and validation of scientific results. Knowledge is embedded in the text of scientific articles for human reading. Web electronic publishing is far from taking full advantage of the facilities offered by Semantic Web and Linked Open Data technologies. Such tasks are increasingly important as the number of scientific articles published in digital formats increases and scientists in their daily work have to process results from different articles and sources. Today PubMed repository holds over 23 million articles. According to Renear and Palmer [1] scientists are increasingly using strategic reading to cope with the amount of literature being published. The tasks outlined demand new tools for information discovery, retrieval, and content comparison in very specific, precise, and meaningful manners. Current information retrieval systems are based in Boolean operators which do not implement explicit meaningful relations between elements which comprise the surrogates of documents or resources they represent. Boolean operators are too general and lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for content retrieval in specific scientific domains. Relations expressed using Boolean operators are processed in the current information retrieval systems as extensive …","pdfUrls":["http://eprints.rclis.org/23856/1/KO-SW%202014.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05d459e171882e280c7ade16bf9c70ec17fc60d3","title":"Representing and Organizing Scientific Knowledge in Biomedical Articles with Semantic Web Technologies","venue":"","year":2014}

The huge amount of services and the wide variety of service specifics require a QoE management on a per-user and per-service basis. This complexity can be tackled through the design of an autonomic QoE management architecture. In this article, the Knowledge Plane is presented as an auto-nomic layer that optimizes the QoE in multimedia access networks from the service originator to the user. It autonomously detects network problems, e.g. a congested link, bit errors on a link, etc. and determines an appropriate corrective action, e.g. switching to a lower bit rate video, adding an appropriate number of FEC packets, etc. The generic Knowledge Plane architecture is discussed, incorporating the triple design goal of an autonomic, generic and scalable architecture. The viability of an implementation using neural networks is investigated, by comparing it with a reasoner based on analytical equations. Performance results are presented of both reasoners in terms of both QoS and QoE metrics. In today's broadband access networks, service operators are focusing on the deployment of new added value services such as Broadcast TV, Video on Demand (VoD), on-line gaming and Voice over IP (VoIP). Each of these services has large service demands: they often require a considerable amount of bandwidth and only tolerate a minimum amount of packet loss, delay and jitter. In order to meet these demands, current access networks are advancing from a best-effort service delivery to a QoS aware triple-play service delivery. Of prime importance in defining the quality of these services is the Quality of Experience (QoE): the quality as experienced by the end-user. The QoE degrades due to certain anomalies in their delivery (e.g. packet loss). The type of degradation depends highly on the type of service and the current context of the network. For example, an interactive service such as VoIP is typically more vulnerable to delay than a broadcast service. In the past, service operators have successfully deployed techniques such as VoD proxies to ensure a certain quality level between the service originator and the access node. However, the same techniques often fail when applied between the access node and the end-devices due to the heterogeneity of current home network configurations. Recently, these …","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2008.11.004","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Piet_Demeester/publication/223777841_An_autonomic_architecture_for_optimizing_QoE_in_multimedia_access_networks/links/02e7e52c18a6aa7bb9000000.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05d52c5e5d2d494f8cedb5fb29d46303f1bd2b85","title":"An autonomic architecture for optimizing QoE in multimedia access networks","venue":"Computer Networks","year":2009}

Familial erythromelalgia (Weir Mitchell's disease), also known as primary erythermalgia, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by burning pain in the extremities in response to warm stimuli or moderate exercise. The cause of this disorder has been enigmatic, and treatment has been empirical and not very effective. Recent studies, however, have shown that familial erythromelalgia is a channelopathy caused by mutations in the gene encoding the Na(v)1.7 sodium channel which lead to altered channel function. Selective expression of Na(v)1.7 within dorsal root ganglion neurons including nociceptors (in which this channel is targeted to sensory terminals, close to impulse trigger zones) and within sympathetic ganglion neurons explains why patients experience pain but do not suffer from seizures or other manifestations of altered excitability within central nervous system neurons. Erythromelalgia is the first human disorder in which it has been possible to associate an ion channel mutation with chronic neuropathic pain. Identification of mutations within a peripheral neuron-specific sodium channel suggests the possibility of rational therapies that target the affected channel. Moreover, because some other pain syndromes, including acquired disorders, involve altered sodium channel function, erythromelalgia may emerge as a model disease that holds more general lessons about the molecular neurobiology of chronic pain.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05d63cd4149fc817f55cf975ca0143772f7e9098","title":"Erythromelalgia: a hereditary pain syndrome enters the molecular era.","venue":"Annals of neurology","year":2005}

As the immunity is specific (I), the hope was at one time entertained that the reaction might be of service in differentiating try-panosome species. This expectation, however, almost vanished when the delicacy of the reaction began to be appreciated. By means of it, Ehrlich 2 (2) and Browning (3), and subsequently the writer (4), were able to distinguish strains of trypanosomes known to have had a common origin, but rendered resistant to various medicaments. With equal clearness the reaction enabled the writer to differentiate normal trypanosomes supposed to have had a common origin, i. e., the organisms of surra of India and surra of Mauritius. Although this extreme delicacy apparently rendered the reaction useless in determining species, objections could be raised to drawing this conclusion from the evidence cited. First, the resistant strains differentiated were no longer normal. As they had acquired new characteristics it seemed scarcely permissible to draw from them inferences as to the behavior of organisms that had never come in contact with therapeutic agents.

Recently, it was shown that the terminal short-arm domain (domains VI and V) of the B1 chain (fragment E4) possesses one of the laminin self-interaction sites [Schittny, J. C. but that the binding partner(s) of this domain is unknown, Using affinity retardation chromatography we now investigate the domain(s) fragment E4 binds to. The elution of E4 was clearly retarded on immobilized laminin and fragment El' (three-chain short-arm complex excluding the distal part of the B1 chain), but not on immobilized E4 in calcium containing buffer and at 37°C. Under the same conditions, El' strongly interacts with immobilized E4. In addition, El' is able to non-covalently cross-link soluble E4 to immobilized E4. No further interaction of laminin and E4 with additional fragments (Pl', A, B2 and B1 chain short-arm complex without B1-domains VI-IV and without globules; E8, distal long arm and G1-3; E3, long-arm G subdomains 4 and 5) could be demonstrated. These data are interpreted as evidence that (a) the primary laminin-laminin bonds are formed between the short arms of laminin, that (b) the terminal B1 short-arm domain (E4) can interact with the short arm(s) of the A and/or B2 chain(s) (domain El'), but does not self-interact, and that (c) due to at least three self-binding sites, laminin polymerization behaves cooperatively. Different isoforms of the basement membrane protein, laminin, have been described. These isoforms are formed by an alternative assembly of genetically distinct polypeptide chains [l]. EHS-laminin, so far the best characterized iso-form, was obtained from the mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor. It consists of three different polypeptide chains (A chain-400kDa; B1 and B2 chains both =200kDa), exhibits a cruciform shape (Fig. l), and possesses a number of protein-binding and cell-binding functions. These functions include binding to itself, to entactinhidogen, to heparin/ heparan sulfate, and to a large variety of cells at distinct binding sites [2, 31. Self-binding results in a defined poly-merization [4]. It is thermally reversible and dependent on the presence of divalent cations, in particular of calcium [4, 51. Depending on the concentration, oligomeric aggregates (critical concentration, 0.1 pM) or even gels are formed in vitro (sol/gel transition =2 pM). The required gel-forming concentration is sufficient to allow each arm to contact its neighbor and is well below the laminin concentration in basement membranes such as in the EHS tumor matrix [6].

Preterminal protein directly binds to the cellular transcription factor nuclear factor III (Oct-1), via the POU homeodomain. Co-precipitation of POU with individual domains of preterminal protein expressed by in vitro translation indicated that POU contacts multiple sites on preterminal protein. Partial proteolysis of preterminal protein in the presence or absence of POU homeodomain demonstrated that many sites accessible to proteases in free preterminal protein were resistant to cleavage in the presence of POU homeodomain. The accessibility of sites in free preterminal protein to cleavage by trypsin was strongly dependent on the ionic strength, suggesting that preterminal protein may undergo a sodium chloride-induced conformational change. It is therefore likely that the POU homeodomain contacts a number of sites on preterminal protein to induce a conformational change which may influence the initiation of adenovirus DNA replication.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/27.13.2799"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05d9d3de21b85dea1a194a4567f0b3a404d700a1","title":"Characterisation of the adenovirus preterminal protein and its interaction with the POU homeodomain of NFIII (Oct-1)","venue":"Nucleic Acids Research","year":1999}

While mapping genomes in 3D has for a long time been elusive, recent adaptations of high-throughput sequencing to chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques, allows for genome-wide structural characterization for the first time. However, reconstruction of \"consensus\" 3D genomes from 3C-based data is a challenging problem, since the data are aggregated over millions of cells. Recent single-cell adaptations to the 3C-technique, however, allow for non-aggregated structural assessment of genome structure, but data suffer from sparse and noisy interaction sampling. We present a manifold based optimization (MBO) approach for the reconstruction of 3D genome structure from chromosomal contact data. We show that MBO is able to reconstruct 3D structures based on the chromosomal contacts, imposing fewer structural violations than comparable methods. Additionally, MBO is suitable for efficient high-throughput reconstruction of large systems, such as entire genomes, allowing for comparative studies of genomic structure across cell-lines and different species.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/74/f3/pcbi.1004396.PMC4532452.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004396","http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/asset?id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004396.s002&unique"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05db540eddb5349d0dbafc910cbd86201c848c75","title":"Manifold Based Optimization for Single-Cell 3D Genome Reconstruction","venue":"PLoS Computational Biology","year":2015}

In SBFL, execution profiles (spectra) of pass and fail test cases are analyzed with SBFL metric to rank software code according to their likeliness to be faulty. However, there are significantly more pass test cases than fail test cases in typical test suites for faulty programs. The domination of pass test cases creates imbalance test suites that have a negative impact on the performance of SBFL. This is attributed to the fact that the execution profiles of fail test cases provide the essential information on the location of faulty code. In this paper, we propose to clone the spectra of fail test cases beyond balanced test suite to improve the performance of SBFL. Our empirical study shows that the proposed cloning method significantly improves the performance of commonly used SBFL metrics. Furthermore, we attempt to identify the amount of cloning required to achieve the optimal performance for the proposed cloning method.","pdfUrls":["http://www.m-hikari.com/ces/ces2014/ces13-16-2014/danielCES13-16-2014.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05db9c21148a3d0fdc4e184841ca2011834d91f6","title":"Improving Spectrum-based Fault-localization through Spectra Cloning for Fail Test Cases beyond Balanced Test Suite","venue":"","year":2014}

We show that, when temporal summation ensues, the erroneous estimation of short-term synaptic plasticity arises partially from the conventional measurement of synaptic dynamics at postsynaptic potential peak time. This can be corrected when measuring overlapping synaptic responses at fixed intervals after stimulus time. Somatic voltage clamp also helps to partially correct for the apparent depression, but a good model of the neuron can do even better in providing a more accurate view of the underlying synaptic conductances.","pdfUrls":["http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/94/1/865.full.pdf","http://www.spike.ls.huji.ac.il/idan/files/banitt_et_al_2005.pdf","http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/early/2005/02/23/jn.00689.2004.full.pdf","http://lobster.ls.huji.ac.il/idan/files/banitt_et_al_2005.pdf","http://lobster.ls.huji.ac.il/~idan/files/banitt_et_al_2005.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05dc15f3dc003e66f85c98c7fb6366027465fac0","title":"Depressed responses of facilitatory synapses.","venue":"Journal of neurophysiology","year":2005}

The CCM originated from the very small, finger-like terminal branches of the macrovasculature of the brain. The superficial cortical arterioles were more numerous than the deep straight arterioles which proceeded toward the white matter. The surface casts of the arterioles and capillaries of the cerebral cortex showed ring-shaped formations in the arterioles and at the origin of the capillaries. All capillaries down-stream from these ring-shaped formations were flaccid. Casts of the capillaries showed wrinkles due to the presence of endothelial folds, which is characteristic of varying blood pressure. Formations having intense anti-GIFAP immunoreactivity were frequently evident along the course of the blood capillaries in the cerebral cortex. These formations were probably astrocytes that might regulate the cerebral microcirculation based on physiological and pathological stimuli, such as neuronal activation.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05dc3cfeec61a21116e5f3c3268318b87ebde482","title":"Microvasculature of the cerebral cortex: a vascular corrosion cast and immunocytochemical study.","venue":"Microscopy research and technique","year":2014}

Recently, polarization has been added to the available input from sensors and accordingly modeled with vector radiative transfer (RT). At any rate, a single pixel is processed at a time using a forward RT model predicated on 1-D transport theory. Neighboring pixels are sometimes considered but, generally, just to formulate statistical constraints on the inversion based on spatial context. Herein, we demonstrate the power to be harnessed by adding bona fide multipixel techniques to the mix. We use a forward RT model in 2-D, sufficient for this demonstration and easily extended to 3-D, for the response of a single-wavelength imaging sensor. The data, an image, is used to infer position, size, and opacity of an absorbing atmospheric plume somewhere in a deep valley in the presence of partially known/partially unknown aerosol. We first describe the necessary innovation to speed-up forward multidi-mensional RT. In spite of its reputation for inefficiency, we use a Monte Carlo (MC) technique. However, the adopted scheme is highly accelerated without loss of accuracy by using \" recycled \" MC paths. This forward model is then put to work in a novel Bayesian inversion adapted to this kind of RT model where it is straightforward to trade precision and efficiency. Retrievals target the plume properties and the specific amount of aerosol. In spite of the limited number of pixels and low signal-to-noise ratio, there is added value for certain nuclear treaty verification applications.","pdfUrls":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2217380","http://i3rc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Publications/Langmore_etal_2013.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05dccbb25ad4ce00232e239158621a86c5267b7b","title":"Multipixel Retrieval of Structural and Optical Parameters in a 2-D Scene With a Path-Recycling Monte Carlo Forward Model and a New Bayesian Inference Engine","venue":"IEEE Trans.

We show that as new granule cells mature, they are increasingly likely to be incorporated into circuits supporting spatial memory. By the time the cells are 4 or more weeks of age, they are more likely than existing granule cells to be recruited into circuits supporting spatial memory. This preferential recruitment supports the idea that new neurons make a unique contribution to memory processing in the dentate gyrus.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05de7fb2d3c31188995c1e8db92f8b3b262c96eb","title":"Preferential incorporation of adult-generated granule cells into spatial memory networks in the dentate gyrus.","venue":"Nature neuroscience","year":2007}

This paper focuses on one important aspect of apoptotic changes in cellular lipids, namely, the redistribution of the mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL). CL predominantly resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane, even if the rapid remodelling of its acyl chains and the subsequent degradation occur in other membrane organelles. After death receptor stimulation, CL appears to concentrate into mitochondrial \"raft-like\" microdomains at contact sites between inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, leading to local oligomerization of proapoptotic proteins, including Bid. Clustering of Bid in CL-enriched contacts sites is interconnected with pathways of CL remodelling that intersect membrane traffic routes dependent upon actin. In addition, CL association with cytoskeleton protein vimentin was observed. Such novel association also indicated that CL molecules may be expressed at the cell surface following apoptotic stimuli. This observation adds a novel implication of biomedical relevance. The association of CL with vimentin at the cell surface may represent a \"new\" target antigen in the context of the apoptotic origin of anti-vimentin/CL autoantibodies in Antiphospholipid Syndrome.","pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/8a/05/JIR2015-847985.PMC4603604.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05e03fe8433ba34c5cbb8f7b7594625417b24f13","title":"Altered Traffic of Cardiolipin during Apoptosis: Exposure on the Cell Surface as a Trigger for “Antiphospholipid Antibodies”","venue":"Journal of immunology research","year":2015}

Their method is based on the regression interval mapping method and allows experimenters to effectively investigate the power for detecting a QTL in a population. This paper continues to work on the power analysis of separating multiple-linked QTLs. We propose simple formulae to calculate the power of separating closely linked QTLs located in marker intervals. The proposed formulae are simple functions of information numbers, variance inflation factors and genetic parameters of a statistical model in a population. Both regression and maximum likelihood interval mappings suitable for detecting QTL in the marker intervals are considered. In addition, the issue of separating linked QTLs in the progeny populations from an F2 subject to further self and/or random mating is also touched upon. One of the primary keys to our approach is to derive the genotypic distributions of three and four loci for evaluating the correlation structures between pairwise unobservable QTLs in the model across populations. The proposed formulae allow us to predict the power of separation when several factors, such as sample sizes, sizes and directions of QTL effects, distances between QTLs, interval sizes and relative QTL positions in the intervals, are considered together at a time in different experimental populations. Numerical justifications and Monte Carlo simulations were provided for confirmation and illustration.","pdfUrls":["http://www.stat.sinica.edu.tw/chkao/GR2010.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05e9471b8c41d2915d85eebf958fe4440a81f950","title":"An investigation of the power for separating closely linked QTL in experimental populations.","venue":"Genetics research","year":2010}

Secondary objectives were to analyse the recanalization rate and outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA prospective observational multicenter study (FUN-TPA) that recruited patients treated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset was performed. Treatments were IVT followed by MT if occlusion persisted, or primary MT when IVT was contraindicated. Outcome measures were procedural complications, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH), recanalization rate, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at 7 days, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score and mortality at 90 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 131 patients, 21 (16%) had medical contraindications for IVT and were treated primarily with MT whereas 110 (84%) underwent IVT, followed by MT in 53 cases (40%). The recanalization rate and procedural complications were similar in the two groups. There were no SICHs after primary MT vs 3 (6%) after IVT+MT. Nine patients (43%) in the primary MT group achieved independence (mRS 0-2) compared with 36 (68%) in the IVT+MT group (p=0.046). Mortality rates in the two groups were 14% (n=3) vs 4% (n=2) (p=0.13). Adjusted ORs for independence in patients receiving standard IVT+MT vs MT in patients with medical contraindications for IVT were 2.8 (95% CI 0.99 to 7.98) and 0.24 (95% CI 0.04 to 1.52) for mortality.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMT is safe in patients with potential comorbidity-derived risks that preclude IVT. MT should be offered, aiming for prompt recanalization, to patients with LVO stroke unsuitable for IVT.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\nNCT02164357; Results.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/05ea3d45f7dafd5e6863b027d6ba6796b93121e7","title":"Mechanical thrombectomy in patients with medical contraindications for intravenous thrombolysis: a prospective observational study.","venue":"Journal of neurointerventional surgery","year":2016}
